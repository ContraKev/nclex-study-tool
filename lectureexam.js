        "answer": "Take this medication in the evening.",
        "rationale": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) like simvastatin are most effective when administered in the evening because hepatic cholesterol synthesis primarily occurs during the night. Aligning the drug's peak concentration with this biological cycle maximizes its efficacy in lowering LDL. Green leafy vegetables are a concern for Warfarin, and position changes are more relevant to antihypertensives that cause orthostatic hypotension. (Slide 30, Ref: Slide 14)"
