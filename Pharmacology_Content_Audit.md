## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The previous "Remastered HTML" guide provided a high-yield "Flashcard" review suitable for rapid recall. However, a deep-dive comparison against the source lecture slides reveals **significant data gaps** regarding second-line agents, adjunctive therapies, and specific pathophysiological contexts (e.g., PAD treatment) that are present in the source material but absent from the summarized guide.

**Status:** ⚠️ **Partial Completeness** (Core Prototypes present; Adjunctive/Niche agents missing).

## 2. DATA GAP MATRIX (Source vs. Current Guide)

### 🫀 CARDIOVASCULAR CLASS GAPS

| Drug Class | Missing Agent/Detail | Clinical Relevance (Source Slide) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anti-Anginals** | **Ranolazine** (Ranexa) | Sodium channel blocker for chronic angina. **QT Prolongation risk.** (Slide 104) |
| **PAD Agents** | **Cilostazol** (Pletal) | Phosphodiesterase inhibitor for **Intermittent Claudication**. (Slide 122) |
| **Alpha-Blockers** | **Prazosin/Doxazosin** | Used for HTN + BPH. Risk of **"First-dose Syncope."** (Slide 82) |
| **Central Agonists** | **Clonidine** | Risk of **Rebound HTN** if stopped abruptly. Patch changed every 7 days. (Slide 85) |
| **Direct Vasodilators** | **Nitroprusside** | IV for Hypertensive Crisis. Risk of **Cyanide Toxicity**. (Slide 90) |
| **Lipid Agents** | **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** | Interaction with **Anticoagulants** (bleeding risk). (Slide 29) |

### 🍭 DIABETES CLASS GAPS

| Drug Class | Missing Agent/Detail | Clinical Relevance (Source Slide) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Amylin Mimetics** | **Pramlintide** (Symlin) | Injectable for Type 1 & 2. **Severe Hypoglycemia risk** (reduce insulin). (Slide 164) |
| **Meglitinides** | **Repaglinide** | "Short/Fast" secretagogue. **Skip meal = Skip dose.** (Slide 158) |
| **Alpha-Glucosidase** | **Acarbose** | **Must take with first bite.** GI side effects (Gas/Bloating). (Slide 161) |
| **Complications** | **Peripheral Neuropathy** | Mentioned as complication requiring adjunctive treatment (Gabapentin). (Slide 186) |

## 3. THE "CROSSOVER" ZONE: DUAL-PURPOSE AGENTS
*Therapeutic agents with indications in both Cardiovascular and Metabolic domains.*

### A. SGLT2 Inhibitors (Empagliflozin/Dapagliflozin)
*   **Primary:** Type 2 Diabetes (Glucosuria).
*   **Crossover:** **Heart Failure (HFrEF).**
*   **Mechanism:** Osmotic diuresis reduces preload; reduction in arterial stiffness reduces afterload.
*   **Slide Evidence:** Slide 162 ("Empagliflozin has been shown to be beneficial in diabetics with heart failure").

### B. GLP-1 Agonists (Semaglutide/Liraglutide)
*   **Primary:** Type 2 Diabetes (Incretin mimetic).
*   **Crossover:** **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction (Stroke/MI).**
*   **Mechanism:** Weight loss (~15%), BP reduction, anti-inflammatory effects.
*   **Slide Evidence:** Slide 164 (Mentions weight loss avg 6.5 lbs; standard care for high-risk CV patients).

### C. ACE Inhibitors (Lisinopril)
*   **Primary:** Hypertension/Heart Failure.
*   **Crossover:** **Diabetic Nephropathy.**
*   **Mechanism:** Dilates efferent arteriole, reducing intraglomerular pressure (kidney protection).
*   **Slide Evidence:** Slide 58 ("Slows progression of diabetic nephropathy").

### D. Beta Blockers (Metoprolol)
*   **Primary:** Hypertension/Angina.
*   **Crossover Warning:** **Diabetes Safety.**
*   **Mechanism:** Blocks sympathetic response. **MASKS hypoglycemia symptoms** (tachycardia/tremors) but *not* sweating.
*   **Slide Evidence:** Slide 80 ("Careful use in diabetics... masks symptoms").

## 4. MISSING REGULATORY & REPORTING DATA
*   **Black Box Warnings:** The source notes mention Amiodarone's Pulmonary/Liver toxicity (Slide 144) but this was not highlighted as a "Black Box" in the summary.
*   **FDA MedWatch:** Not explicitly covered in the slides, but critical for professional practice (as requested in prompt).

## 5. RECOMMENDATION FOR "ULTIMATE" HTML HUB
To achieve 100% completeness, the new HTML interface must:
1.  **Dynamic Filtering:** Toggle between "Core" and "Advanced/Niche" drugs.
2.  **Interactive Matrix:** A visual table showing the Crossover agents.
3.  **Embedded Case Studies:** The "Review" scenarios from the PDF files (e.g., Heparin administration technique) must be interactive quizzes.
4.  **Full Monograph Access:** Expandable sections for drugs like Ranolazine and Pramlintide.

*This report confirms the need for a V2 "Ultimate" HTML build.*
