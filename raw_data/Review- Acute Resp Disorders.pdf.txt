 Review:  Acute  Resp  Disorders  For  those  who  want  to  begin  for  tomorrow's  quiz.  This  quiz  will  be  reviewed  at  end  of  class  today,  I'll  update  this  announcement  once  the  quiz  is  
finalized.

 Thanks!    Quiz  18  Review  Epistaxis  with  Nasal  Packing   Frequent  swallowing  after  nasal  packing  indicates  that  blood  may  be  moving  posteriorly  rather  
than
 
externally-
 
continuous
 
bleeding
 The  nurse  recognizes  this  as  a  complication  requiring  immediate  assessment.  Antimicrobial  Therapy  for  Acute  Bronchitis   The  goal  of  therapy  is  complete  eradication  of  the  pathogen.  Stopping  therapy  early  contributes  to  drug  resistance  and  recurrence  of  infection.  Client  teaching  focuses  on  adherence,  not  symptom  relief.  Hypoxia  –  Recognizing  the  Progression   Early  neurological  and  compensatory  cues:   restlessness  agitation  increased  heart  rate  increased  respiratory  rate  Late  oxygenation  failure  cues:   visible  color  changes  decreased  level  of  consciousness  Obstructive  Sleep  Apnea   Diagnosis  requires  a  sleep  study  called  polysomnography  that  evaluates  breathing  patterns,

 Allergic  Rhinitis  Pharmacology   The  primary  medications  target  the  histamine-mediated  inflammatory  response  aka  
anti-histamines
 Antihistamines  can  be  oral  or  nasal  Anti-infectives  are  not  effective  for  allergen-triggered  conditions.  Post-Procedure  Airway  Protection   After  procedures  that  suppress  the  gag  reflex:   Oral  intake  is  withheld  until  the  nurse  verifies  the  return  of  the  protective  airway  reflex.  
Airway  safety  takes  priority  over  nutrition  and  comfort.  Cough  Medications    Some  medications  suppress  the  cough  reflex-  antitussives  Some  increase  secretion  production  to  make  the  cough  more  productive-  mucolytics  or  
expectorants
 Some  reduce  inflammation  in  the  airway-  corticosteroids  or  bronchodilators  A  productive  cough  is  treated  by  mobilizing  secretions,  not  suppressing  them.  Asthma  –  Rescue  vs  Maintenance  Therapy   Rescue  therapy  characteristics:   rapid  onset  relieves  bronchospasm  during  an  acute  attack  administered  by  inhalation  or  nebulization  for  immediate  effect  Maintenance  therapy  characteristics:   prevents  inflammation  slow  onset  not  effective  for  acute  symptoms  Inhaled  Corticosteroids  –  Adverse  Effects   Local  immunosuppression  in  the  oropharynx  increases  the  risk  for  fungal  overgrowth.  Preventive  teaching  includes  mouth  cleansing  after  administration.  Breath  Sounds  and  Their  Meaning   A  high-pitched  sound  during  expiration  indicates  air  moving  through  narrowed  airways.  –  
expiratory
 
wheezing.
 Crackling  sounds  are  associated  with  fluid  in  the  alveoli.  Low-pitched  coarse  sounds  suggest  thick  secretions  in  larger  airways  Thoracentesis  Positioning   Positioning  allows  fluid  to  collect  in  the  dependent  portion  of  the  pleural  space,  making  removal  
easier.
 The  client  leans  forward  (commonly  across  a  table)  to  separate  the  ribs  and  expand  access  to  
the
 
pleural
 
area.
 Pneumothorax  Assessment   Air  in  the  pleural  space  prevents  normal  lung  expansion.  The  nurse  expects  reduced  or  absent  breath  sounds  on  the  affected  side.  Chest  Tube  Management   The  drainage  system  is  always  kept  below  chest  level  to  prevent  backflow.  Water  used  in  the  system  must  be  sterile  to  prevent  infection.  
The  drainage  container  is  not  routinely  emptied;  output  is  marked  for  measurement  (typically  
with
 
a
 
sharpie)
 If  disconnection  occurs,  a  temporary  water  seal  is  created  rather  than  clamping.  End-of-Life  Breathing  Patterns   Cheyne-Stokes  respirations:   alternating  depth  of  breathing  periods  of  apnea  gradual  progression  toward  respiratory  failure  Atelectasis  (Postoperative)   Collapse  of  alveoli  leads  to:  increasing  work  of  breathing  tachypnea  decreased  oxygenation  Prevention  and  treatment  focus  on  lung  expansion  techniques.  Pulmonary  Embolism  –  Priority  Intervention   Using  the  ABC  approach:   The  first  action  supports  oxygenation  and  ventilation.  Pain  control  and  cardiac  monitoring  are  not  the  initial  priority.  Oxygen  Saturation  –  Nursing  Actions   When  oxygen  saturation  is  low:   The  nurse  promotes  maximum  lung  expansion.  Interventions  that  depress  respirations  are  avoided.  Deep  breathing  and  coughing  are  encouraged  frequently,  not  every  several  hours.  Pneumonia  –  Expected  Findings   fever  tachypnea  tachycardia  purulent  secretions  adventitious  breath  sounds  Hypothermia  and  bradycardia  are  not  typical  compensatory  responses  to  infection.   Priority  Setting  –  ABCDE  Framework   Airway  compromise  takes  priority  over:  fever  confusion  
decreased  urine  output  MDI  (meter  dose  inhaler  use)  –  Correct  Technique  &  Effectiveness   Correct  technique  includes:   waiting  between  inhalations  using  a  spacer  to  improve  lung  delivery  Medication  effectiveness  is  demonstrated  by:   decreased  work  of  breathing  reduced  wheezing  improved  oxygen  saturation  no  accessory  muscle  use  Airway  Obstruction  –  Immediate  Cues   high-pitched  inspiratory  sound  visible  retractions  cyanosis  labored  respirations  NGN  Clues   Hypoxia   ↓  oxygen  saturation  restlessness  or  agitation  tachycardia  tachypnea  cyanosis  (late)  Respiratory  Infection   fever  thick  yellow/green  secretions  adventitious  breath  sounds  inflammation  on  imaging
