Chapter 27

Medical-Surgical Nursing, 7th Edition
Presentation Title
2
Objectives
For selected acute respiratory disorders, describe the pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, complications, diagnostic measures, and medical treatment.
Assist in developing a nursing care plan for the patient who has an acute respiratory disorder.

Acute Bronchitis
Cause and risk factors: Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi in the lower respiratory tract.
Bacterial causes such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae and noninfectious inhaled toxins such as cigarette smoke
Signs and symptoms: cough (productive and nonproductive), sputum production, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, wheezing or rhonchi, fever, chest pain, and other symptoms similar to upper respiratory tract infections such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and sore throat; Peripheral edema and Elevated red blood cell count

4
Acute Bronchitis
Medical diagnosis: Diagnosed based on the health history and clinical presentation
Increased red blood cells (RBCs)
Nursing care: Focuses on symptom management and patient education
Emphasize good handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, and proper disposal of tissues 
The patient should avoid contact with vulnerable individuals while symptomatic

Medical treatment: Medications that may reduce acute cough include antitussive agents such as dextromethorphan or the expectorant guaifenesin
Treatment consists of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7 to 10 days; hospitalization is usually unnecessary

5
Influenza
Acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses
Influenza usually occurs in epidemics during the winter months
Influenza is similar to the common cold in the way that it is spread; that is, through droplet infection. However, its symptoms differ from those of the common cold 
Ongoing monitoring is particularly important with influenza because of the risk of serious complications, especially in older adults

6
Influenza
Signs and symptoms: Abrupt onset
Symptoms: High fever (102 to 104° F; 38.9 to 40° C) that lasts 3 to 4 days. Headache, general body aches and pains, exhaustion, and fatigue and weakness
Medical diagnosis: Flu tests available to detect influenza viruses- Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs)

Medical treatment: Most effective way to prevent flu is to have a yearly vaccine
Treat S/S- rest, fluids, proper diet, antipyretics, and analgesics
Nursing care: Similar to care of the patient with the common cold

7
Pneumonia
People who are most likely to contract pneumonia are smokers; those with altered consciousness from alcohol, seizures, anesthesia, or drug overdose; those who are immunosuppressed; chronically ill people who are malnourished or debilitated; and people on bedrest with prolonged immobility.
Although most people recover from pneumonia, it remains among one of the leading causes of death, especially in older adults.
People with bacterial pneumonia may experience an abrupt, almost explosive onset: severe shaking chills; sharp, stabbing lateral chest pain, especially with coughing and breathing; and intermittent cough with rusty sputum. 
Viral pneumonia is characterized by burning or searing chest pain in the sternal area; a continuous hacking, barking cough producing small amounts of sputum; and headache.

Pleurisy (Pleuritis) 
Inflammation of the pleura 
Causes: pneumonia, tuberculosis, injury to the chest wall, pulmonary infarction, and tumors 
Symptom of pleurisy is abrupt and severe pain
Treatment: underlying disease and pain relief 
Nursing care

When the patient reports pain, obtain a complete description including location, severity, precipitating factors, and alleviating factors. 
Monitor the patient’s breathing pattern with attention to the symmetry of chest movement.

9
Chest Trauma 
Chest trauma can result in changes in normal pressure relationships between air inside and outside the body, interference with normal breathing patterns and protective mechanisms such as cough, disturbances in blood flow to the lungs, swelling, and pain. 
Immediate care of a person with a chest injury is directed at stabilization and prevention of further injury.

Pneumothorax
Monitor the patient closely for increasing respiratory distress as indicated by tachycardia, dyspnea, cyanosis, restlessness, and anxiety. 
Patients feel like they are suffocating and may fear they are dying 
Monitor the patient’s pulse and blood pressure. 
Be alert for signs of pain and document the characteristics of the patient’s pain

11
Hemothorax
Blood accumulation between chest wall and lung that is often associated with pneumothorax 
From lacerated or torn blood vessels or lung tissues, lung malignancy, or pulmonary embolus 
When air or blood collects in pleural space, pressure around lung increases; causes partial/complete collapse 
Treated like pneumothorax; nursing care similar 
Surgical intervention: control source of bleeding

12
Rib Fractures
13
It takes approximately 6 weeks for rib fractures to heal.
Treatment is aimed at relief of pain so that the patient can have good chest expansion for adequate breathing.

Flail Chest Chapt 63
Ventilation is impaired, and the patient becomes hypoxemic
The treatment of flail chest varies depending on the severity of the condition 
Flail chest is more serious and the patient may be acutely ill; anxiety may be very high

14
Pulmonary Embolus
The effects depend on the extent of the lung tissue that is deprived of blood. 
Small emboli usually do not cause dramatic symptoms but disrupt perfusion nevertheless. 
If a large pulmonary vessel is obstructed, alveoli collapse, cardiac output falls, there is constriction of the bronchi and the pulmonary artery, and sudden death may ensue.
Monitor the patient’s respiratory rate and effort, breath sounds, skin color, pulse, and blood pressure. 
Anticoagulant therapy poses a risk of uncontrolled bleeding; assess for excessive bruising or bleeding.

Respiratory Arrest
See current American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of respiratory arrest 


17
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a progressive pulmonary disorder that follows some trauma to the lung. From 6 to 72 hours after the trauma, pulmonary infiltrates develop and lung compliance decreases
Fluid shifts into the interstitial spaces in the lungs and into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema
Early detection and treatment are critical factors in treating ARDS successfully

Chronic Lower Respiratory Tract Disorders
Chapter 28

Medical-Surgical Nursing, 7th Edition
Objectives
21
Identify examples of chronic inflammatory, obstructive, and restrictive pulmonary diseases.
For selected chronic respiratory disorders, describe the pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, complications, diagnostic measures, and medical treatment.
Assist in developing a nursing care plan for the patient with a chronic respiratory disorder.
Explain the relationship between cigarette smoking and chronic respiratory disorders.

Asthma
The incidence of asthma has been increasing
It occurs across the life span, from the very young to the very old
It is a highly complex condition that can be a mild nuisance or a very serious, life-threatening condition

Pathophysiology:
Chronic obstructive airway disorder; airway inflammation that is triggered by allergens or irritants
Inflammatory process results in bronchial hyperresponsiveness, bronchial constriction and edema, thickening of bronchial walls, and the production of thick mucus
Result of innate (inborn) immunity, genetics, and environmental factors
22
Asthmaticus
Complications:
Asthmaticus: Severe, persistent bronchospasm
If not corrected- can lead to right-sided heart failure, pneumothorax, worsening hypoxemia, acidosis, and respiratory or cardiac arrest
Repeated exacerbations can cause hypertrophy of bronchial smooth muscle, thickening of the tissues in the airways, hypertrophy of mucus glands, air trapping in the alveoli, and hyperinflation of the lungs
23
Asthma
Signs and symptoms:
Dyspnea, productive cough, use of accessory muscles of respiration; audible expiratory wheezing, tachycardia, and tachypnea 
Air moving through the narrowed airways causes wheezing 
Respiratory arrest: Drowsiness, confusion, absence of wheezing, bradycardia, and retractions above the sternum
Medical diagnosis: Based on the health history, the physical examination, and spirometry
Medical treatment: Primary goal of medical therapy is to control asthma
24
Nursing care: Asthma
Inadequate Oxygenation: Monitor the patient's respiratory rate, pattern, and effort. Support the patient in the Fowler position and give O2 as ordered
Administer prescribed bronchodilators and monitor for improvement or adverse effects of drug therapy
Patients should be taught to use peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) meters routinely. Measures expired air to evaluate ventilation
Twice daily to establish a baseline (personal best) PEFR and then daily to monitor level of control. Daily PEFR reading is 80% to 100%.
25
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Progressive, largely irreversible airflow obstruction that cannot be explained by any other diagnosis
Pathophysiology: Chronic inflammation of the respiratory bronchioles, alveoli, and pulmonary blood vessels
26
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
With chronic hypoxemia, the red blood cell count is typically elevated to compensate for the inadequate oxygen in the blood
As emphysema progresses, the patient also may have dyspnea when at rest
Corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of the inflammatory response in asthma, but whether they are effective with bronchitis and emphysema is controversial 
Theophylline blood levels must be monitored because toxicity can cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.
High levels of oxygen are not administered because patients with COPD may rely on hypoxic drive to breathe

27
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Complications:
Respiratory failure and Heart failure
Respiratory failure is marked by hypoventilation and ventilation-perfusion and respiratory acidosis
Signs and symptoms:
Earliest sign of COPD is commonly a chronic cough
dyspnea upon exertion and a sense of heaviness in the chest
Weight loss and fatigue
28
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Medical diagnosis:
Patient's health history and physical examination
Most reliable diagnostic tests for COPD are the PFTs, which reveal a decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC) accompanied by increases in functional residual capacity (FRC) and RV
Medical treatment: Goals of medical treatment are to attain symptom relief, slow disease progression, improve exercise tolerance, prevent or treat complications, and improve overall health
Smoking Cessation: Nicotine patches; Only about 25% are successful
29
Oxygen Therapy
Pt. should rinse the mask or collar with clear, warm water every 4 to 8 hr as necessary
Make sure the straps on the mask are secure but not too tight adjust them for a snug but not tight fit
Check the tops of ears regularly for skin breakdown: The straps holding the mask in place can erode the skin they rest on, so it is important to check the ears regularly
Post “no smoking” warning signs at home in a prominent location: Oxygen in the home increases the risk of fire injuries. No one in the house should use smoking materials, electric razors, portable radios, open flames, or wool blankets in the area where oxygen is in use
Protecting the nares is important, but the client should use water-based lubricant: Oxygen has a high combustion potential, and petroleum products are combustible
30
Nursing care: COPD
The patient may be referred to a rehabilitation program that includes exercise reconditioning 
Progressive walking program: 10 to 15 minutes a day
Activity intolerance, related to inability to meet O2 needs: Bunch all activities and treatments close together
Pursed-lip breathing slows expiration, prevents collapse of alveoli, and helps the client to control the rate and depth of respirations.

Nutrition is important for the patient with COPD because malnutrition causes decreased energy and decreased resistance to infection and because obesity increases the work of breathing
Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements
Offer small, frequent meals
Combat Anorexia: Perform oral hygiene before meals
Encourage the client to drink 8 glasses of water a day



31
Focused Assessment Nursing
Record any presenting symptoms—often dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or a combination of these problems; Stasis of respiratory secretions
Before determining the appropriate interventions the pt’s respiratory status must be updated
List of current medications and drug allergies
Functional assessment to explore the effect of the condition on the patient's activities of daily living (ADL) and inquire about exposure to smoke or other respiratory irritants
Right-sided heart failure: Decrease Urine output

32
Bronchiectasis
Abnormal dilation/distortion of bronchi and bronchioles; usually confined to one lung lobe or segment
Patient is said to have chronic bronchitis when the increased production of mucus and chronic cough persist for at least 3 months of the year for 2 consecutive years.
Follows recurrent inflammatory conditions, infections, or obstructions but is sometimes congenital 
Signs: coughing, production of large amounts of purulent sputum; fever, hemoptysis, nasal stuffiness, sinus drainage, fatigue, and weakness. Exertional dyspnea, Elevated red blood cell count
Goals: control symptoms and prevent spread
33
Cystic Fibrosis
Most patients do not develop diabetes because the endocrine function of the pancreas is still adequate.
Allow the patient to maintain as much control as possible and try to maintain the patient’s usual routines during hospitalization

Hereditary disorder characterized by dysfunction of the exocrine glands and production of thick, tenacious mucus 
Cough is the first pulmonary symptom 

34
35
Cystic Fibrosis
Treatment: Treatment consists of pancreatic enzyme replacement, CPT, and aerosol and nebulizer treatments with hypertonic saline or recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) to reduce mucus viscosity.
Alternatives to manual chest physiotherapy include the ﬂutter mucus clearance device, a handheld tool that vibrates to loosen secretions and promotes movement of secretions out of the lungs. 
Nursing care: Goals of nursing care are to maintain a patent airway, prevention or treatment of infection, adequate nutrition, and effective management
Administer the medication with meals and snacks

36
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis was a leading cause of death in the United States until effective drugs became available in the 1940s and 1950s. 
The cough is often persistent and productive and may produce bloody sputum (hemoptysis).
People who have been infected mount an immune response that causes a local reaction when tuberculin, a protein fraction of the tubercle bacillus, is injected intradermally 

37
Tuberculosis
Cause and risk factors: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an acid-fast aerobic bacterium, causes TB 
Spread through droplets emitted during coughing, laughing, sneezing, and singing
Signs and symptoms:  cough, night sweats, chest pain and tightness, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and low-grade fever. The cough is often persistent and productive and may produce bloody sputum (hemoptysis)
Pathophysiology: Initial TB infection is called the primary infection
Invades the lung, a small area becomes inflamed
Body's immune response attempts to destroy the infecting organisms but some may escape and be carried into the lymph nodes or throughout the body(necrotic degeneration)

38
Tuberculosis
Medical diagnosis:
Tuberculin skin tests: Local reaction when tuberculin, a protein fraction of the tubercle bacillus, is injected intradermally 
Positive reaction if a hard area (induration) of 5 mm or more develops at the site within 48 to 72 hours (positive reaction may indicate active or inactive infection)
Medical treatment: Positive results for TB on skin tests and negative results on chest radiographs but who are at increased risk for the disease are usually treated prophylactically to prevent development of active TB
Treated with isoniazid (INH) alone daily for 9 months or INH with rifapentine weekly for 3 months. Rifapentine is not an option for all patients (Directly observed therapy) (DOT)
Usual course of therapy for active TB ranges from 6 to 24 months after sputum cultures become negative
39
Nursing care
The risk of adverse effects with long-term drug therapy is significant, so patient monitoring is essential. 
Patient Teaching Box: Tuberculosis.
Rifampin causes body fluids to become red-orange and may stain soft contact lenses.
40
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
Chronic Restrictive Pulmonary Disorder
Formation of scar tissue in the lung tissue after inflammation or irritation
Related to cigarette smoking, frequent aspiration, or exposure to environmental or occupational substances
Corticosteroid treatment may prevent additional damage but does not correct existing ﬁbrosis

41
Sarcoidosis
Pathophysiology: Inflammatory condition that may affect the skin, eyes, lungs, liver, spleen, brain, bones, salivary glands, joints, and heart
Signs and symptoms: dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and fever

42
Occupational Lung Diseases
Inhalation of particles in the work setting such as dust, ammonia, chlorine, plant and animal proteins, silica, asbestos, and coal dust.
OSHA provides regulations intended to protect workers.
Asbestosis is a pneumoconiosis caused by occupational exposure to asbestos, an insulating material. 

Acute respiratory irritation
Occupational asthma
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Pneumoconiosis

43
Lung Cancer
The incidence is decreasing among men but has been rising steadily among women
 Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer

44
Lung Cancer
Cause and risk factors: Risk is increased for smokers who are exposed to other carcinogenic substances, such as arsenic, asbestos, and radioactive materials 
Secondhand smoke poses a threat to nonsmokers 
Air pollution may be an additional risk factor 


Pathophysiology: Two major categories of lung cancer exist: 
(1) small cell (“oat cell”) lung carcinoma (SCLC)
(2) non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
Signs and symptoms: persistent cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and recurring pneumonia or bronchitis. Dyspnea; weight loss; and pain in the shoulder, arm, or hands

45
Lung Cancer
Medical diagnosis: Radiographic and Imaging procedures

Medical treatment: Radiotherapy may be used alone or in combination with other treatment methods 
Chemotherapy may be used alone or with radiation in the treatment of SCLC 
Targeted biologic therapies that block the activity of growth factor receptors are being studied for their value in cancer treatment
Surgical treatment: The goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor while removing as little healthy surrounding tissue as possible


46
Nursing Care of the Patient With Lung Cancer
Thoracotomy: Chapt 25
Nurses must continue to educate the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking to help eliminate the primary cause of lung cancer
47
Extrapulmonary Disorders 
Chest deformities interfere with lung expansion 
Neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affect the muscles of respiration 
Head or spinal cord injuries can disrupt the breathing center in the brain or the neural control of the diaphragm 
Heart failure with pulmonary edema fills lungs with fluid, interfering with the exchange of gases

48
Drugs Used to Treat Lower Respiratory Disease
Chapter 30

Clayton’s Basic Pharmacology for Nurses, 19th edition
Objectives
Discuss nursing assessments used to evaluate the respiratory status of a patient.
Distinguish the mechanisms of action of expectorants, antitussives, and mucolytic agents.
Describe the nursing assessments needed to monitor therapeutic response and the development of adverse effects from beta-adrenergic bronchodilator therapy.

50
The Lower Respiratory Tract and the Alveoli
Respiratory tract is series of airways that start with nose and mouth; end at alveolar sacs
Nose and mouth airways connect at pharynx
Human lungs contain 300 to 500 million sacs for gaseous exchange
Primary function of lower respiratory tract is ventilatory cycle
Ventilation: Movement of air into and out of the lungs.
During inspiration, the diaphragmatic and intercostal muscles contract, creating a vacuum in the lungs and pulling air in through mouth and nose.
During exhalation, relaxation of the muscles allows the chest to return to its unexpanded position, forcing air out of the lungs.

51
Common Lower Respiratory Diseases
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Chronic airflow limitation disease (CALD)
Asthma
Chronic bronchitis
Emphysema
Respiratory diseases are divided into two types: Obstructive and restrictive.
Obstructive airway diseases are asthma and acute bronchitis.
Restrictive airway diseases are chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

52
Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs)
Components
pH: 7.35 to 7.45
PaCO2: 35 to 45 mm Hg
PaO2: 80 to 100 mm Hg
HCO3: 24 to 28 mEq/L
SaO2 (oxygen saturation): 95%
Pulmonary function tests have been developed to assess the ventilation and diffusion capacity of the lungs to assist in diagnosis and give an objective assessment of improvement or deterioration of the patient’s clinical condition.

53
Spirometry
54
Routinely used to assess capability of patient’s lungs, thorax, and respiratory muscles
Spirometer measures volumes of air
Patient is considered to have significant reversibility of airway obstruction if there is 15% to 20% improvement in the FEV1 (or PEFR) after bronchodilator therapy
FEV1: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second.
PEFR: Peak expiratory flow rate

Asthma
Chronic airway disease
Responsible for an excessive number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, healthcare provider office visits, and deaths
Inflammatory disease of bronchi and bronchioles
Subdivided into categories based on severity
Intermittent
Mild persistent
Moderate persistent
Severe persistent
55
Chronic Bronchitis
Condition in which chronic irritation causes inflammation and edema
Refers to chronic productive cough that is present for 3 months in each of 2 successive years; no other identifiable cause
Patients are prone to recurrent respiratory infections

56
Emphysema
Disease of alveolar tissue destruction without fibrosis
Classic patient with emphysema
Dyspneic with minimal exertion
Breathes through pursed lips
Is thin
Is barrel chested
Has scanty sputum production with minimal cough
57
Treatment of Lower Respiratory Diseases 
Cough: Treatment of cough is of secondary importance; primary treatment aimed at underlying disorder
Asthma
Goals: Maintain normal activity levels; maintain near-normal pulmonary function rates; prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms; prevent exacerbations; minimal use of short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist; avoid adverse effects

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Goals: Relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve health status
Bronchodilators are cornerstone
Pharmacotherapy recommendations are based on patient’s symptoms and history of exacerbations
Long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be avoided

58
Drug Therapy for Lower Respiratory Diseases
59
Attempt to relieve symptoms of cough by liquefying thick secretions to prevent mucus plugs, or suppressing cough
Expectorants
Antitussives
Mucolytic agents
Bronchodilators
Antiinflammatory agents
Immunomodulators
Nursing Assessments
60
Obtain: History, medications, description of current symptoms
Perform:
Respiratory assessment: Percussion, auscultation, palpation, inspection
Review:
Cardiovascular health, sleep pattern, psychosocial health, laboratory and diagnostic data, smoking history recorded in pack years
Multiply number of packs smoked per day by number of years smoking

Administration of Inhalants
61
Review with patients during each visit
Demonstration of how to use the inhaler
Exhale completely before inhaling
Hold breath at least 10 seconds afterward
Administer bronchodilator first, wait several minutes, give steroid inhalant
Rinse mouth after steroid medication
Patient Education and Health Promotion
