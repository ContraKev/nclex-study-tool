Anatomy of the Respiratory System
Nose
Sinuses
Throat
Trachea
Bronchi
Lungs
The sinuses are spaces in the bones of the skull; they are lined with mucous membrane and filled with air. 
The throat consists of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and the larynx.

Physiology of the Respiratory System
Respiratory center: 
Breathing is controlled by the respiratory center-located in the medulla
The medulla is part of the brainstem immediately above the spinal cord
The respiratory center is stimulated by changing levels of CO2 and O2 in arterial blood

Present health
Past health history
Family history
Review of systems
Functional assessment
Physical examination
Head and neck
Thorax

The nurse’s examination of the nose and sinuses is usually confined to inspection of the external nose and palpation over the paranasal sinuses
A nasal speculum and a lighted scope are used to observe the mucosa of the nasal cavity

6
Physical Examination
Thorax: Inspect the chest for deformities and lesions and observe the breathing pattern and effort
Palpate the thorax for tenderness and lumps
Auscultate the lungs bilaterally in a systematic manner
*Coarse crackles: Caused by secretions accumulating in the larger airways and usually clear with coughing
7
Hypoxemia vs Hypoxia
Hypoxemia is low oxygen levels in your blood
Hypoxia is low oxygen levels in your tissues
Symptoms: Restlessness, Headache, Rapid or difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate and bluish skin
Heart and Lung conditions put you at risk for hypoxemia
Hypoxia: Reduced oxygen content in tissue and cells
Manifestations of hypoxia include agitation and restlessness due to neurological changes from poor oxygen exchange
Oxygen therapy prevents or relieves hypoxia
O2 Must be ordered by a health care provider and closely monitored by the nurse

8
Types of Breathing Patterns Table 25.1
Normal: Depth: even Rate: 12–20 breaths per minute

Tachypnea: Depth: even Rate: faster than 20 breaths per minute
Fever, pain, anxiety

Bradypnea: Depth: even Rate: slower than 12 breaths per minute
Sedatives, opioids, and alcohol; brain, metabolic, and respiratory disorders

Apnea: Pattern: respirations cease for several seconds 
Persistent cessation is respiratory arrest

Cheyne-Stokes respirations, apnea: Breaths progressively deeper, then becoming more shallow, followed by period of apnea
Severe brain pathology/death
9
Age-Related Changes Box 25.1
Nasal obstruction more common because of the softening of the cartilage of the external nose 
Mucous membrane thinner; produces less mucus 
Epistaxis (nosebleed) more common in older people
Decline in the sense of smell as people age 
Tissues of larynx are drier and less elastic in older adult 
Weakened esophageal sphincter allows gastric contents to flow back into the throat when the patient lies down

Some older people report having a watery or “runny” nose when eating spicy or hot foods 
The older person may fail to detect smoke or gas in the home or may neglect personal hygiene owing to failure to notice body odors
Some people complain of a constant tickling sensation that causes them to clear the throat frequently

Throat culture
Laryngoscopy
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
 Radiologic studies
Imaging procedures
Pulmonary function tests
Pulse oximetry
Sputum analysis
Fluoroscopy
Throat Culture

Pulmonary function tests
13
Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy
Bronchoscopy: Used to visualize abnormalities, take biopsy samples of lesions, or remove foreign bodies
Obtain signed consent. Patient status should be NPO for 6–8 hours or as specified. Have the patient remove any dentures and provide oral hygiene. Document any loose teeth. Ask the patient not to smoke. Administer sedative and anticholinergics as ordered

Patient status should be NPO until gag reflex returns and placed in semi-Fowler position 
Monitor the patient's vital signs as well as for gross hemoptysis, swelling of face and neck, stridor, decreased or asymmetric chest movement, diminished lung sounds, and dyspnea 
Report any abnormal findings to the physician.
14
Fluoroscopy
Used to provide motion radiographs of lungs
Taken to observe deep structures in motion
Screen registers a constant image of the chest
Fluoroscopic examination can give information about the speed and degree of lung expansion and structural defects in the bronchial tree
15
Drug Therapy
Adrenergic agents
Anticholinergics
Antihistamines
Corticosteroids
Antipyretics
Analgesics
Anesthetics
Antiinfectives

Drug Therapy: Drugs Used to Treat Respiratory Disorders Table 25.4
Decongestants: 
Oral: pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) 
Topical: azelastine (Astepro)
Constricts blood vessels to reduce swelling of mucous membranes. Used to treat nasal discharge, common cold
*Sudafed used with caution in those with severe hypertension and coronary artery disease
Opioid antitussives: Codeine
Opioid antitussives: codeine, hydrocodone
Suppresses cough reflex. Appropriate to control nonproductive cough or cough that interferes with rest or wound healing.
Codeine antitussive is a Schedule V controlled substance. Is an opioid and therefore has abuse potential and can cause sedation
Encourage fluids unless contraindicated to facilitate expectoration of secretions. Take safety measures if the patient is drowsy

18
Bronchodilators
Inhaled short-acting: Albuterol
Decrease mucus secretion, increase mucociliary clearance, and stabilize mast cells. Significant cardiac stimulation
Restlessness, anxiety, tachycardia, headache, hypertension, disorientation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Teach the patient to use an inhaler and to rinse the mouth after inhalation to decrease dryness and irritation. Avoid excessive caffeine. Monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status

19
Therapeutic Measures 
Thoracentesis
Breathing exercises
Chest physiotherapy
Humidification and aerosol therapy
Oxygen therapy
Intermittent positive pressure breathing treatments
Artificial airways

Mechanical ventilation
Chest tubes
Tracheostomy suctioning
Tracheostomy care
Nasal surgery
Thoracic surgery
Video thoracoscopy
20
Thoracentesis
Insertion of a large-bore needle through the chest wall into the pleural space
To remove pleural fluid, blood, or air or to instill medication
Pleural fluid may be removed to reduce respiratory distress caused by fluid accumulation in the pleural space
Position: Sitting on the side of the bed bent over bedside table
21
Tracheostomy Suctioning
Suctioning is done to remove secretions from the upper airway
Depending on the site of the secretions, you may need to suction the oral cavity, the oropharynx, the nasopharynx, or the trachea
Suction only when evidence indicates. Signs: Increased heart and respiratory rates, restlessness, noisy expiration, mucus is apparent in the tracheostomy tube and ventilator is increased peak airway pressure
22
Thoracic Surgery: Pneumonectomy
Pneumonectomy: Removal of an entire lung
Contraindications to percussion and vibration
After pneumonectomy, also avoid the complete side-lying position on the affected side because this may encourage mediastinal shift. Administer oxygen as ordered
23
Atelectasis
Partial or Complete collapse of the lung
Caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung
Risk factors include: Anesthesia, prolonged bed rest with few changes in position, shallow breathing and underlying lung disease
24
Mechanical Ventilation
Mechanical ventilation is the process of providing respiratory support by means of a mechanical device called a ventilator
Most commonly required for patients with acute respiratory failure who are unable to maintain adequate gas exchange in the lungs
Three types of positive pressure ventilators exist: 
(1) volume cycled 
(2) pressure cycled 
(3) time cycled
Positive end-expiratory pressure may be prescribed to keep the pressure in the lungs greater than the atmospheric pressure at the end of expiration
25
Chest Tubes
Inserted to drain air or fluid from the pleural space of the lungs
Permits Reexpansion of a collapsed lung in the patient with a hemothorax, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion
A small incision is made to insert one chest tube in the second to fourth intercostal space to remove air
Pleural drainage device composed of three compartments: 
(1) The collection chamber 
(2) The water seal chamber
(3) The suction control chamber
26
Mechanical Ventilation: C-PAP
CPAP unit: Individuals with sleep apnea 
CPAP maintains positive pressure in the airway during sleep, thereby preventing periods of apnea 
CPAP units are small and have a face mask that is worn during sleep

Upper Respiratory Disorders
Chapter 26

Medical Surgical Nursing
Objectives
31
Explain the pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, complications, and medical or surgical treatment of selected disorders of the nose, sinuses, and throat.
Assist in developing nursing care plans for patients with disorders of the nose, sinuses, or throat.

Sinusitis
Inflammation of the sinuses, most often the maxillary and frontal sinuses 
Signs and symptoms: Headache/Pain or a feeling of heaviness over the affected sinus; purulent drainage from the nose; pain may seem like a toothache
32
Nasal Polyps
Swollen masses of sinus or nasal mucosa and connective tissue that extend into the nasal passages 
Corticosteroids inhaled nasally may be prescribed 
Surgical removal under local anesthesia, however, is often necessary 
Nasal polyps tend to recur
Nursing care after nasal polyp surgery
33
Allergic Rhinitis
“Hay fever”: acute (seasonal) or chronic (perennial) 
Follows exposure to a substance (allergen) that causes an allergic response 
Signs and symptoms 
Medical diagnosis 
Medical treatment
Nursing care

34
Acute Viral Coryza
The common cold:
Can be caused by any of some 30 viruses 
It is contagious and spread by droplet infection 
Signs and symptoms 
Complications
Medical treatment 
Prevention 
Nursing care

35
Acute Viral Coryza
Medical management of the common cold is primarily directed at relief of symptoms
People with colds are most contagious during the first 2 or 3 days after symptoms appear 
The very young, the very old, and those with weakened immune systems especially should be protected from exposure

36
37
Tumors
Tumors can be benign or malignant. 
Sinus malignancies are more common among people in certain occupations—notably furniture makers. 
External nasal tumors are usually either basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas. 
The earlier a malignancy is detected and treated, the better the chances of survival. 

38
Deviated Nasal Septum
Nose divided into two passages by a cartilaginous wall called the septum 
Major deviations can obstruct the nasal passages and block sinus drainage 
Headaches, sinusitis, and epistaxis
Treatment: submucosal resection/nasal septoplasty

39
Epistaxis
Nosebleed; from trauma, clotting disorders, dryness, inflammation, and hypertension 
The nose has an abundant blood supply that permits it to bleed easily. 
An ice pack or a cold compress can be applied to the nose regardless of whether facial trauma has occurred. 
Once the bleeding stops, advise the patient not to blow the nose for several hours because this may trigger renewed bleeding. 
Epistaxis may be controlled by having the patient sit up and lean forward slightly. Then pinch the patient’s nostrils.

40
Epistaxis: Nursing care
Severe epistaxis is an emergency
Priority data: evidence of uncontrolled bleeding and excessive blood loss
Inspect the nose and back of the throat for obvious bleeding and observe for frequent swallowing
41
42
Pharyngitis
Inflammation of the mucous membranes of the throat or pharynx 
Usually occurs along with acute rhinitis or sinusitis.
Patients with bacterial pharyngitis are more likely to have serious complications than those with viral pharyngitis. 
Obtain the culture specimen before the antibiotics are started. 
Fluids must be increased cautiously in the elderly because they do not adjust well to sudden changes in blood volume. 

43
44
Tonsillitis
Inflammation of tonsils/other throat lymphatic tissue 
The culture and sensitivity identify the pathogenic organisms present and what antibiotics are likely to be effective 
A peritonsillar abscess is an infection of the tissue surrounding the tonsil 

45
Tonsillectomy
Surgical Treatment: Tonsillectomy
A patient (usually a child) is diagnosed with strep throat 7 or more times in 1 year, the physician may suggest surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy)
Considered when enlarged tonsils cause difficulty breathing, or when they contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
An elective surgery
*The decision to remove a child's tonsils must be weighed against the risks of anesthesia and bleeding, as well as the missed school days to recover from the procedure
46
Tonsillectomy
Nursing care after Tonsillectomy
Nursing Care Plan: Patient Having a Tonsillectomy
Pain related to tissue trauma: Patient will state that pain is relieved and will appear more relaxed
Administer analgesics as ordered. Apply an ice collar as ordered. Give cold or frozen liquids when permitted Provide simple explanations and reassurance
A chest radiograph also may be ordered to assess for respiratory complications

47
Obstructive Sleep Apnea 
Airway obstruction during sleep 
Symptoms related to disrupted sleep pattern 
Symptoms can affect many aspects of life 
Concentration and memory may be impaired 
Hypertension and cardiac dysrhythmias 
Diagnosis confirmed by polysomnography
Conservative treatment: weight loss if obese, avoidance of sedatives and alcohol for 3-4 hours before bedtime 
Surgical procedures
48
Laryngitis
Inflammation of the larynx 
The physician may use a laryngeal mirror to examine the larynx for color, edema, and growths such as polyps and tumors
49
Laryngeal Nodules
Benign masses of fibrous tissue result primarily from voice overuse but can follow infections 
Singers and public speakers prone to development of nodules 
The only symptom is hoarseness 
Nodules are surgically removed under local or general anesthesia
The removal of nodules is usually fairly simple, but they may recur if the voice is again misused. 

50
Laryngeal Polyps
Swollen mass of mucous membrane attached to vocal cord 
Can cause continuous or intermittent hoarseness, depending on its location and attachment 
In heavy smokers, masses may develop on both cords 
A procedure called stripping of the vocal cords is necessary to treat this condition 
Voice rest prescribed if polyps removed

51
Cancer of the Larynx
Cancer of the larynx accounts for more than 10,000 new cancers each year. 
It causes approximately 4000 deaths yearly and is increasing in frequency. 
The cure rate is highest for patients with tumors that are conﬁned to the vocal cords.
Factors: exposure to smoke or other noxious fumes, alcohol consumption, vocal strain, and chronic laryngitis 
Malignant tumors can develop throughout the larynx: above the glottis, on the vocal cords, or below the vocal cords 

52
Cancer of the Larynx
Laryngeal cancer is often caused by chronic exposure to tobacco and alcohol
Persistent hoarseness is an early manifestation of cancer of the larynx because the presences of a tumor can impede the action of the vocal cords during speech
Radiotherapy alone can cure some small cancers that have not spread to surrounding tissues 
Chemotherapy may be administered as palliative treatment, before surgery to reduce tumor size, or postoperatively to reduce the risk of metastasis

53
Focused Assessment: Laryngectomy
Assessment focuses on oxygenation, circulation, and comfort
Weight changes, ability to swallow, and effectiveness of alternate means of communication
The physician and speech therapist can advise the patient about appropriate alternatives for speech
The patient with a supraglottic laryngectomy is at increased risk for aspiration pneumonia. 

54
Nursing Care of the Patient
If the patient will lose the ability to speak, information about other means of communication should be available
Anticipated loss of the voice is very stressful to patients. Listen compassionately and accept the patient's expressions of anger or despair
Intravenous fluids and enteral feedings are usually ordered at first
Considerable difficulty swallowing when oral nourishment is resumed
Potential airway obstruction, pain, and inadequate knowledge for self-care
55
Nursing Interventions
Potential Airway Obstruction
Anxiety
Decreased Cardiac Output
Pain
Potential for Injury
Inadequate Nutrition
Increased risk for aspiration pneumonia
Prevent Aspiration: Patient must learn supraglottic swallowing
Steps for Performing the Supraglottic Swallow Box 26.1
Seat the patient upright with the head flexed slightly forward
Suction machine should be on hand
56
Pulmonary Embolus
Postoperative: At risk for developing a pulmonary embolus due to immobility
Monitor for sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, cyanosis, tachycardia, and low blood pressure to identify a pulmonary embolus
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia A platelet count of 74,000/mm3 is below the expected reference range 
57
Emergency Interventions for Chest Injuries Table 63.2
Pneumothorax: an open chest wound penetrates the pleural cavity, allowing air to enter, which collapses lung on affected side(Sucking Chest Wound)
Signs and symptoms: Dyspnea, asymmetric chest wall movement, “sucking” sound as air moves in and out of wound with respirations.
EMERGENCY INTERVENTION:
Air-occlusive dressing taped on three sides (vented dressing)
Apply vented dressing: sealed on three sides so air can escape but not enter the wound
58
Emergency Interventions for Chest Injuries Table 63.2
Flail chest:
Several adjacent ribs are broken in more than one place, causing a loss of support in the affected section of the chest wall.
Signs and symptoms: The affected section moves inward on inspiration and outward on expiration. This abnormal chest wall movement, called paradoxical motion, impairs gas exchange (see Fig. 63.5)
Provide support for the injured area. Hold or tape a small pad or pillow over the injury to splint the ribs
59
Drugs Used to Treat Upper Respiratory Disease
Chapter 29

Clayton’s Basic Pharmacology for Nurses, 19th edition
Objectives
61
Discuss the causes of allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and rhinitis medicamentosa.
Explain the major actions (effects) of sympathomimetic, antihistaminic, and corticosteroid medicines.
Explain why all decongestant products should be used cautiously by people with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic disease.
Discuss the nursing assessments needed during therapy to monitor the therapeutic response to and the common and serious adverse effects of decongestant drug therapy.

Anatomy of Upper Respiratory Tract
Respiratory system is series of airways that start with nose and mouth; end at alveolar sacs within lungs
Upper respiratory tract is composed of nose and its turbinates
Sinuses
Nasopharynx
Pharynx
Tonsils
Eustachian tubes
Larynx

62
Common Upper Respiratory Diseases
Rhinitis
Inflammation of nasal mucous membrane
Causes of acute symptoms: Common cold, bacterial infection, presence of foreign body, drug-induced congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa)
Allergic rhinitis
Caused by allergic reaction on exposure to allergens such as pollens, grasses, dust mites
Releases large amounts of histamine
63
Common Upper Respiratory Illnesses: Cold Virus
Expensive illness
Most common in midwinter, spring, and fall
120 to 200 subtypes of viruses, spread by direct contact and sneezing
Symptoms
Clear, watery nasal discharge, sneezing
Cough, mild sore throat
Headache, malaise, chills, and fever
Should resolve over 5 to 7 days

64
Complications From Cold Viruses
Sinusitis: Thick, tenacious mucus obstructs sinus ducts
Otitis media: Infection of the middle ear
Exacerbations of obstructive lung disease, asthma
Contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or if additional symptoms appear with a cold

65
Treatment of Upper Respiratory Diseases
Common cold: Limited to relieving symptoms; reducing complications; preventing spread of viral infection
Allergic rhinitis
Identify allergens; avoid exposure
Medicines block allergic reaction; treat symptoms
Rhinitis medicamentosa: Prevention; frequent follow-up
Decongestants are the most effective agent for relieving nasal congestion and rhinorrhea

66
Drug Therapy of Upper Respiratory Diseases
Actions and uses
Antihistamines are drugs of choice for treating allergic rhinitis
Antiinflammatory agents administered intranasally are used to treat nasal symptoms resulting from mild to moderate allergic rhinitis
Nursing implications
Description of symptoms
History of treatment
History of concurrent medical problems
Nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis are treated with prescription or OTC medicines 
The roles of the nurse in the healthcare provider’s office are to perform the initial assessment of symptoms and then focus on teaching the proper techniques for self-administering and monitoring of the medication therapy

67
Drug Class: Sympathomimetic Decongestants
Action: Stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors of nasal mucous membranes causing vasoconstriction
Use: Relieve congestion associated with rhinitis
Therapeutic outcomes: Reduced nasal congestion, easier breathing
Common adverse effect: Mild nasal irritation

Often used in conjunction with antihistamines to treat allergic rhinitis
Administered orally or topically as nasal spray; if used improperly, it can lead to rebound swelling
68
Drug Class: Sympathomimetic Decongestants
Serious adverse effect: Hypertension
Used with caution in patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic hyperplasia
State laws regulate purchase of pseudoephedrine, one ingredient in methamphetamine manufacture
Combining with MAOIs results in significant hypertension

69
Drug Class: Antihistamines
Action: Compete with allergy-liberated histamine for H1 receptor sites
Uses: Treat allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis
Therapeutic outcome: Reduced symptoms of allergic rhinitis
Common adverse effects: Sedative effects, cognitive impairment, drying effects

Each drug differs in frequency and adverse effects.
For best results, take on a scheduled basis and use before symptoms are expected to occur. Antihistamines will not stop nasal congestion
70
Drug Class: Antihistamines
Anticholinergic adverse effects
Dry mouth, stuffy nose
Blurred vision
Constipation, urinary retention
May make respiratory mucus thicker
Patients with history of asthma, prostatic enlargement, or glaucoma should take antihistamines only with healthcare provider supervision

71
Drug Class: Respiratory Antiinflammatory Agents
Drug: Intranasal corticosteroids
Action: Reduce inflammation; mechanism of action unknown
Use: For patients who do not respond to antihistamines or sympathomimetic agents
Therapeutic outcomes: Reduced rhinorrhea, rhinitis, itching, sneezing
Common adverse effect: Nasal burning
Use only for short-term acute seasonal allergies
72
Intranasal Corticosteroids
Reduced rhinorrhea, rhinitis, itching, sneezing
73
Drug Class: Respiratory Antiinflammatory Agents
Drug: Cromolyn sodium (NasalCrom)
Action: Stabilizes mast cells, reducing the release of histamine and other mediators
Use: In conjunction with other drugs to treat severe allergic rhinitis
Common adverse effect: Nasal burning
Serious adverse effects: Bronchospasm, coughing
Nonprescription.
Usefulness is often limited because of the need for frequent dosing.
May be most beneficial when used as a prophylactic treatment before an anticipated allergen exposure or in patients whose medical conditions do not allow the use of other medications (e.g., pregnancy).

74
Use of Decongestants 
Alpha-adrenergic agents as nasal decongestant
Stimulate alpha receptors at other sites in the body
Use only for short-term acute seasonal allergies
Excessive use of decongestants may result in significant hypertension
Patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic hyperplasia should only use these products if advised to do so by a healthcare provider or pharmacist.

75
Premedication and Nursing Assessments
Description of symptoms
History of treatment
History of concurrent medical problems
See specific assessments for decongestants, antihistamines, and corticosteroids in the textbook
Always review the patient’s history for other diseases currently being treated (e.g., hypertension, glaucoma, asthma, prostatic hyperplasia) that may contraindicate the concurrent use of some upper respiratory medications used as OTC or prescribed treatments
