**Slide 95: Propranolol Contraindication**
*   **Question:** Which condition is a contraindication for taking propranolol?
*   **Correct Answer:** **Asthma.**
*   **Rationale:** Non-selective beta-blockade causes bronchoconstriction.

**Slide 96: Captopril Adverse Effect**

## IV. ANGINA & HEART FAILURE

**Slide 106: Nitroglycerin Headache**
*   **Question:** Client has a headache after sublingual nitroglycerin. What is the appropriate response?
*   **Correct Answer:** **"A headache is a common adverse effect... will probably occur less often over time."**

**Slide 107: Nitroglycerin Emergency**
*   **Question:** Client reports nausea and unrelieved chest pain 5 min after taking 1 nitroglycerin tablet. Action?
*   **Correct Answer:** **Instruct the client to call 911.**
*   **Rationale:** Pain unrelieved by the first dose may indicate an MI; call 911 before taking the 2nd dose.

**Slide 108: Verapamil Teaching**
*   **Question:** Discharge education for a client prescribed verapamil for angina?
*   **Correct Answer:** **Monitor for decreased heart rate.**
*   **Rationale:** Verapamil is a non-DHP CCB that slows conduction and HR. (Also: high-fiber diet).

**Slide 115: Digoxin Toxicity Signs**
*   **Question:** Manifestations of digoxin toxicity to report? (Select all)
*   **Correct Answers:** **Fatigue; Anorexia; Blurred vision.**
*   **Rationale:** Also include nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and halos.

**Slide 116: Digoxin Toxicity Risk**
*   **Question:** Which client is at risk for digoxin toxicity?
*   **Correct Answer:** **A client who takes furosemide for hypertension.**
*   **Rationale:** Low potassium (hypokalemia) sensitizes the heart to digoxin.

## V. ANTICOAGULANTS & THROMBOEMBOLICS

**Slide 133: Subcutaneous Heparin**
*   **Question:** Appropriate teaching for a client starting subcutaneous heparin?
*   **Correct Answer:** **Use a soft bristle toothbrush.**
*   **Rationale:** Bleeding precautions are mandatory for anticoagulants.

**Slide 134: Heparin Administration**
*   **Question:** Action to administer heparin SC to a client with DVT?
*   **Correct Answer:** **Insert the needle at a 90 degree angle.**
*   **Rationale:** Standard SQ injection technique; **do not aspirate or massage** (prevents bruising/hematoma).

**Slide 135: INR Monitoring**
*   **Question:** Accurate response regarding the INR test while taking warfarin?
*   **Correct Answer:** **"This is a standardized test, so it eliminates the variations different laboratories report in PT times."**
*   **Rationale:** INR provides a consistent measurement regardless of the lab reagent used.
