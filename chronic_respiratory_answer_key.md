## **M-052: COPD Management - GOLD Guidelines & Exacerbation**

### **Patient:** Margaret Simmons, 68F with severe COPD (GOLD Group D)

### **Step 1: Extended SATA**
**Question:** Which nursing interventions are appropriate for her management?
**Correct Answers:** 0,1,2,3,4,7 (6 items)
- Administer nebulized albuterol 2.5mg and ipratropium 0.5mg every 4 hours
- Initiate oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 >92%
- Start systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40mg daily)
- Administer azithromycin 500mg daily for 5 days
- Encourage pursed-lip breathing and diaphragmatic breathing techniques
- Monitor for signs of respiratory failure requiring NIV

**Rationale:** COPD exacerbation management follows GOLD guidelines: bronchodilators, oxygen therapy, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics for purulent sputum. Pursed-lip breathing helps control dyspnea. NIV may be needed for respiratory failure.

### **Step 2: Matrix**
**Question:** Match the GOLD COPD assessment criteria with the appropriate classification
**Answers:**
- FEV1 ≥80% predicted with minimal symptoms → GOLD Group A (Low risk, fewer symptoms)
- FEV1 50-79% predicted with increasing breathlessness → GOLD Group B (Low risk, more symptoms)
- FEV1 30-49% predicted with decreased exercise capacity → GOLD Group C (High risk, fewer symptoms)
- FEV1 <30% predicted or FEV1 <50% with respiratory failure → GOLD Group D (High risk, more symptoms)

**Rationale:** GOLD classification combines spirometry (risk assessment) with symptom burden.

### **Step 3: Bowtie**
