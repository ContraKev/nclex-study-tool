## Mission 1: The Golden Glow: A Digitalis Dilemma (M-001)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse analyzes the assessment findings and laboratory data. Which findings require immediate nursing intervention? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Heart rate of 48 bpm
- [x] Serum Potassium 3.1 mEq/L
- [x] Visual report of 'yellow halos'
- [x] Digoxin level 2.8 ng/mL
- [x] Anorexia and nausea

**Rationale**:
> The patient is presenting with classic signs of Digoxin toxicity (bradycardia, yellow halos, nausea/anorexia) which is being exacerbated by critical hypokalemia (3.1) likely caused by the increased Furosemide dose. The sodium and 1+ edema are non-emergent findings.

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: For each assessment finding, indicate whether the finding is consistent with Digoxin toxicity, Furosemide adverse effects, or both.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Hypokalemia (Low Potassium) | **Furosemide Effect** |
| Visual halos (Yellow/Green) | **Digoxin Toxicity** |
| Profound Bradycardia | **Digoxin Toxicity** |
| Dehydration/Hypotension | **Furosemide Effect** |
| Loss of Appetite (Anorexia) | **Digoxin Toxicity** |

**Rationale**:
> The patient is experiencing a complex pharmacological interaction between a cardiac glycoside and a loop diuretic. Hypokalemia is a direct adverse effect of Furosemide, which inhibits sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport in the loop of Henle, leading to excessive potassium excretion. Visual disturbances (yellow/green halos), profound bradycardia, and anorexia (loss of appetite) are classic and specific manifestations of Digoxin toxicity. Dehydration and hypotension are common consequences of aggressive fluid mobilization via loop diuretics. It is critical to understand that hypokalemia significantly potentiates Digoxin toxicity because low extracellular potassium levels allow more digoxin to bind to the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, drastically increasing its effects and risk of arrhythmia.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient is diagnosed with severe Digitalis Toxicity. Complete the bowtie diagram by choosing the most appropriate potential condition, two nursing actions, and two parameters to monitor.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Digoxin Toxicity
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Hold current dose of Digoxin
  - Administer Digoxin Immune Fab (Digibind)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Continuous EKG monitoring
  - Serum Potassium levels

**Rationale**:
> The definitive diagnosis is Digoxin Toxicity, confirmed by the toxic serum level of 2.8 ng/mL and the patient's neurological and cardiac symptoms. Primary nursing interventions must focus on stabilization and reversal: holding the medication prevents further toxic accumulation, while Digoxin Immune Fab (Digibind) acts as the specific antidote by binding to and inactivating the drug molecules. Monitoring must prioritize cardiac and metabolic stability; continuous EKG is mandatory to identify lethal dysrhythmias (like PVCs or AV block) that occur in digitalis toxicity. Tracking serum potassium is equally vital, as hypokalemia exacerbates toxicity, and rapid changes in potassium can occur during the reversal process.

## Mission 2: The Silent Crisis: Nitroprusside Titration (M-002)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse is preparing the Nitroprusside (Nitropress) infusion. For each action, indicate if it is required or contraindicated for the safe administration of this medication.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Protecting the IV bag and tubing from light with opaque covering | **Required** |
| Administering the drug via a gravity drip set for rapid control | **Contraindicated** |
| Discarding the solution if it displays a blue, green, or bright red tint | **Required** |
| Using a dedicated large-bore peripheral 22g IV for the primary line | **Contraindicated** |

**Rationale**:
> Nitroprusside is extremely light-sensitive; exposure to UV light causes it to decompose into cyanide. The IV bag and tubing MUST be wrapped in aluminum foil or an opaque sleeve. It is a potent vasodilator that requires precise titration via an electronic infusion pump; gravity drips are strictly contraindicated. A change in color (blue/green/red) indicates chemical breakdown and toxicity. While a large-bore IV is good, a central line or arterial line for monitoring is the standard of care due to the risk of extreme hypotension and extravasation.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: After 36 hours of high-dose Nitroprusside infusion, the nurse assesses Mr. Vance. Which findings would alert the nurse to potential cyanide toxicity? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] New-onset confusion and disorientation
- [x] Metabolic Acidosis noted on ABGs
- [x] A faint odor of bitter almonds on the breath
- [x] Muscle twitching and agitation

**Rationale**:
> Cyanide toxicity is a life-threatening complication of nitroprusside metabolism. Signs include CNS changes (confusion, agitation, tremors), metabolic acidosis (due to interference with cellular respiration), and the classic 'bitter almond' breath odor. Muffled heart sounds are signs of tamponade (Minoxidil risk), and bradycardia is not the primary sign of cyanide poisoning.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient's MAP has dropped to 60 mmHg and he is becoming increasingly lethargic. Complete the bowtie diagram by choosing the most likely condition, two nursing actions, and two parameters to monitor.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Severe Hypotension
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Stop Nitroprusside infusion
  - Place patient in Trendelenburg
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Blood Pressure every 2 minutes
  - Level of consciousness

**Rationale**:
> The patient is experiencing profound, life-threatening hypotension, which is the most common and immediate adverse effect of Nitroprusside due to its potent vasodilatory action on both venous and arterial smooth muscle. The most urgent nursing priority is to stop the infusion immediately; since Nitroprusside has an extremely short half-life (1–10 minutes), blood pressure typically begins to recover very rapidly once the drug is discontinued. Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position (head down, feet elevated) is a standard emergency maneuver to facilitate venous return to the heart and improve cerebral perfusion during the acute hypotensive state. Monitoring must transition to emergency frequency: blood pressure must be assessed every 2 minutes via the existing arterial line to guide recovery, and the level of consciousness must be evaluated continuously to ensure that cerebral oxygenation is improving as systemic pressure normalizes.

## Mission 3: Post-MI Stability: Beta-Blocker Bridge (M-003)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse provides discharge teaching regarding the Metoprolol Succinate (Toprol XL). Which instructions are essential for the patient's safety? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Do not stop this medication abruptly under any circumstances
- [x] Check your radial pulse for one full minute before each dose
- [x] You may notice that your usual signs of low blood sugar (shakiness/heart racing) are missing
- [x] Notify the provider if you develop a new cough or shortness of breath at rest
- [x] Monitor your blood glucose more frequently during the first few weeks

**Rationale**:
> 1. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers can cause life-threatening rebound hypertension and myocardial ischemia. 2. A pulse check is mandatory to ensure the rate is not < 50-60 bpm. 3. Beta-blockers mask the tachycardia and tremors associated with hypoglycemia, which is critical for this diabetic patient. 4. SOB and cough can indicate new-onset heart failure (decreased contractility). 5. Dosing must be consistent, not PRN.

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Ms. Chen asks about potential side effects. The nurse should categorize the following symptoms as common/expected or as 'Red Flags' that require immediate medical notification.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Feeling slightly more tired than usual | **Common / Expected** |
| New onset of wheezing or 'tightness' in the chest | **Red Flag (Notify Provider)** |
| A weight gain of 3 lbs in a 24-hour period | **Red Flag (Notify Provider)** |
| A resting heart rate of 58 beats per minute | **Common / Expected** |
| Cold hands and feet | **Common / Expected** |

**Rationale**:
> Nurses must differentiate between the manageable side effects of beta-blockade and indicators of life-threatening complications. Fatigue, mild bradycardia (HR > 50), and cold extremities are expected pharmacological effects resulting from decreased cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction. However, new-onset wheezing is a 'Red Flag' indicating bronchospasm (even with cardioselective agents like metoprolol, Beta-2 receptors in the lungs can be partially blocked at certain doses). Similarly, rapid weight gain (> 2 lbs/day) is a hallmark sign of fluid retention and worsening acute heart failure, caused by the drug's negative inotropic effect reducing the heart's pumping force during the early stabilization phase. Immediate provider notification is mandatory for these findings.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Four weeks after discharge, Ms. Chen calls the clinic reporting she feels 'extremely weak' and her pulse is 42 bpm. Complete the bowtie for this clinical situation.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Symptomatic Bradycardia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Hold the Metoprolol dose
  - Instruct patient to come to the ED
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Continuous EKG rhythm
  - Blood pressure stability

**Rationale**:
> The patient is presenting with symptomatic bradycardia (pulse < 50 bpm accompanied by weakness), likely due to toxic accumulation or an excessive physiological response to the Metoprolol Succinate. The primary nursing action is to immediately hold further doses of the offending agent to prevent cardiac standstill. Instructing the patient to come to the Emergency Department is critical because she requires an acute evaluation for potential AV block and may need temporary pacing or pharmacological support (e.g., Atropine). In the acute setting, continuous EKG rhythm monitoring is the highest priority to detect lethal arrhythmias, while frequent blood pressure assessment is required to ensure that systemic perfusion is maintained despite the low heart rate.

## Mission 4: The Irregular Pulse: AFib Management (M-004)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse admits Mr. O'Connell. Which assessment findings are consistent with Atrial Fibrillation with RVR? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Heart rate > 100 bpm
- [x] Irregularly irregular pulse
- [x] Palpitations
- [x] Pulse deficit (Apical > Radial)

**Rationale**:
> AFib is characterized by chaotic atrial activity (no P waves) and an irregular ventricular response. RVR implies a rate > 100. A pulse deficit is common as not all beats generate enough pressure to be palpable peripherally. QRS is typically narrow unless there is aberrant conduction.

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The provider orders medications. For each drug, indicate the primary purpose in this scenario.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Diltiazem (Cardizem) IV | **Rate Control** |
| Heparin IV Drip | **Anticoagulation** |
| Metoprolol PO | **Rate Control** |
| Amiodarone IV | **Rhythm Control** |

**Rationale**:
> Diltiazem and Metoprolol are rate control agents (slowing AV conduction). Heparin prevents thrombus formation (stroke prevention). Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic used to restore/maintain sinus rhythm (rhythm control).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient suddenly develops slurred speech and right-sided weakness. Prioritize the immediate response.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Ischemic Stroke (Embolic)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Activate Stroke Team/Code Stroke
  - Obtain Non-contrast CT Head
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - NIHSS Stroke Scale
  - Serum Glucose

**Rationale**:
> The greatest risk in AFib is embolic stroke (clot leaving the LA appendage). Slurred speech and weakness are classic signs. Immediate action is to call a Stroke Code and get a CT to rule out hemorrhage. Glucose is checked to rule out hypoglycemia mimics. tPA is NOT given until hemorrhage is ruled out.

---

## Mission 5: The Silent Killer: Hypertensive Urgency (M-005)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse assesses Ms. Jenkins. Determine which findings indicate 'Target Organ Damage' vs 'No Target Organ Damage'.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL | **No Evidence of Organ Damage** |
| Severe Headache | **No Evidence of Organ Damage** |
| Proteinuria (Negative) | **No Evidence of Organ Damage** |
| Chest Pain / Troponin elevation | **Evidence of Organ Damage** |
| Epistaxis (Nosebleed) | **No Evidence of Organ Damage** |

**Rationale**:
> Urgency is defined by BP > 180/120 WITHOUT organ damage. Headache and epistaxis are symptoms but not organ 'damage' like MI (chest pain), renal failure (high Cr), or stroke.

### Step 2: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Based on the assessment (High BP, No Organ Damage), prioritize the care plan.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Hypertensive Urgency
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer Oral Clonidine
  - Place in quiet, dark room
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - BP every 15-30 mins
  - Neuro checks q1h

**Rationale**:
> The diagnosis is Urgency. Treatment involves ORAL agents (Clonidine/Captopril) to lower BP gradually over 24-48h. IV agents are for Emergency. Reducing stimuli assists in lowering BP. Neuro checks ensure no progression to stroke.

### Step 3: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Ms. Jenkins is discharged. Which statements require further teaching? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] I can stop the medication when my headache goes away.
- [x] If I miss a dose, I will double up the next day.

**Rationale**:
> Hypertension is a silent, lifelong condition. Medication adherence is crucial even when asymptomatic. Doubling doses can cause dangerous hypotension.

## Mission 6: Drowning from Within: Acute Pulmonary Edema (M-006)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse reviews the medication order for Ethacrynic acid (Edecrin). Why is this specific loop diuretic chosen over the more common Furosemide (Lasix)? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] The patient has a documented anaphylactic allergy to sulfonamides
- [x] Ethacrynic acid is the only loop diuretic that does not contain a sulfa moiety
- [x] Furosemide is chemically derived from sulfonamides and carries a cross-reactivity risk

**Rationale**:
> Loop diuretics like Furosemide, Bumetanide, and Torsemide are all sulfonamide derivatives. While the risk of cross-reactivity is debated, clinical standards dictate that in patients with a history of true anaphylaxis to sulfa drugs, these agents should be avoided. Ethacrynic acid is the only loop diuretic that is not a sulfonamide, making it the essential choice for this patient. However, the nurse must be aware that Ethacrynic acid actually carries a HIGHER risk of permanent ototoxicity (hearing loss) compared to Furosemide, especially in the elderly or those with renal impairment. It is chosen here solely for its unique chemical structure to bypass the allergy risk.

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: After 30 minutes of therapy, the nurse evaluates the patient's progress. Classify each finding as an indicator of therapeutic improvement or as a potential adverse effect of the diuretic therapy.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| A urine output of 1,200 mL within the first 60 minutes | **Therapeutic Improvement** |
| New-onset tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and hearing fullness | **Adverse Effect** |
| SpO2 improvement to 94% on 2L Nasal Cannula | **Therapeutic Improvement** |
| Patient reports severe leg cramps and muscle weakness | **Adverse Effect** |
| Crackles are now only audible in the lower lung bases | **Therapeutic Improvement** |

**Rationale**:
> Therapeutic success in pulmonary edema is measured by rapid diuresis, improved oxygenation, and 'drying' of the lungs (as crackles recede from the apices to the bases). Adverse effects of high-dose loop diuretics are predictable and dangerous: rapid fluid shifts can lead to hypokalemia, manifested as muscle weakness and leg cramps. Most critically, Ethacrynic acid is highly ototoxic; tinnitus or hearing changes are major 'Red Flags' that must be reported immediately to prevent permanent deafness. These findings represent the delicate balance between clearing the lungs and causing systemic toxicity.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient is now breathing easier but reports feeling 'heart flutters.' The cardiac monitor shows multiple Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs). Complete the bowtie for the highest priority complication.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Severe Hypokalemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Request stat Potassium replacement
  - Hold further diuretic doses
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - EKG for U-waves and arrhythmias
  - Serum Potassium levels

**Rationale**:
> Aggressive loop diuretic therapy rapidly depletes potassium, which is critical for cardiac electrical stability. The onset of PVCs and 'heart flutters' in this patient strongly suggests severe hypokalemia. The nurse must act immediately to stop further potassium loss by holding the diuretic and must advocate for urgent potassium replacement (IV or PO depending on severity). Continuous EKG monitoring is the highest priority to detect lethal progression into Ventricular Tachycardia or the appearance of U-waves, while serial serum potassium checks are required to guide replacement therapy and ensure the patient returns to a safe range (3.5-5.0 mEq/L).

## Mission 7: The Bridging Game: Heparin to Warfarin (M-007)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse educates the patient on the rationale for 'Bridging Therapy.' Which statements accurately explain why both medications are required simultaneously? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Warfarin has a delayed onset of 3 to 5 days before reaching therapeutic levels
- [x] Heparin provides immediate anticoagulation while the Warfarin is building up
- [x] Warfarin initially depletes Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C
- [x] A transient pro-thrombotic state can occur in the first 48 hours of Warfarin therapy

**Rationale**:
> Warfarin works by inhibiting the synthesis of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). Because it does not affect factors already circulating in the blood, it takes 3-5 days to become effective. Crucially, Warfarin also inhibits Protein C and S (natural anticoagulants) which have shorter half-lives than the pro-coagulant factors. This can create a transient 'hypercoagulable' window where the risk of new clots actually increases. Continuous Heparin provides immediate protection by inactivating thrombin and factor Xa, 'bridging' the patient safely until the INR reaches the therapeutic target (usually 2.0-3.0).

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse must monitor specific laboratory values to adjust the dosing of anticoagulants. Correctively link the medication to its primary monitoring parameter.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Unfractionated Heparin continuous IV infusion | **aPTT** |
| Warfarin (Coumadin) oral tablets | **PT / INR** |
| Enoxaparin (Lovenox) subcutaneous injection | **No Routine Monitoring Required** |
| Dabigatran (Pradaxa) oral capsules | **No Routine Monitoring Required** |

**Rationale**:
> Unfractionated Heparin has an unpredictable half-life and must be adjusted using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to maintain a therapeutic range (1.5-2.5 times the control). Warfarin is monitored via the Prothrombin Time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) to ensure consistent levels across different labs. Low Molecular Weight Heparins (like Enoxaparin) and Direct Oral Anticoagulants (like Dabigatran) have highly predictable pharmacokinetics and do not require routine laboratory monitoring in most patients.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: On day 4 of therapy, the patient suddenly develops a severe nosebleed (epistaxis) and her urine appears bright red. Her morning INR was 5.8. Complete the bowtie for the primary concern.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Warfarin Toxicity / Overdose
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer Vitamin K (Phytonadione)
  - Hold the next dose of Warfarin
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Repeat INR levels
  - Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

**Rationale**:
> The patient is experiencing an acute bleeding event due to an excessively high INR (5.8), indicating Warfarin toxicity. The primary nursing action is to hold the medication to prevent further anticoagulation and administer Vitamin K, which is the specific antagonist that allows the liver to resume synthesis of clotting factors. While leafy greens contain Vitamin K, they are not used for acute reversal. Monitoring must focus on the INR to track the effectiveness of the reversal and the Hemoglobin/Hematocrit to assess the severity of blood loss from the epistaxis and hematuria.

---

## Mission 8: Fluid Overload: CHF Management (M-008)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Differentiate the patient's symptoms between Right-Sided and Left-Sided Heart Failure.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Jugular Venous Distention (JVD) | **Right-Sided HF** |
| Crackles / Pulmonary Edema | **Left-Sided HF** |
| Peripheral Edema (Legs) | **Right-Sided HF** |
| Orthopnea (SOB lying flat) | **Left-Sided HF** |
| Ascites / Hepatosplenomegaly | **Right-Sided HF** |

**Rationale**:
> Left HF backs up into the Lungs (Crackles, Orthopnea). Right HF backs up into the Rest of the body (JVD, Ascites, Edema). This patient has biventricular failure.

### Step 2: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient becomes increasingly dyspneic, SpO2 drops to 85%, and he starts coughing pink frothy sputum. Take immediate action.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Flash Pulmonary Edema
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer IV Furosemide
  - Place High Flow Oxygen / BiPAP
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Urine Output
  - SpO2 and Respiratory Effort

**Rationale**:
> Pink frothy sputum is pathognomonic for Flash Pulmonary Edema. This is an AIRWAY emergency. Diuretics (Lasix) remove fluid. Positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) pushes fluid out of alveoli. Laying flat kills the patient.

### Step 3: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient stabilizes. Which discharge instructions are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Weigh yourself daily at the same time
- [x] Restrict fluid intake to 1.5 - 2L per day
- [x] Limit Sodium intake to < 2g per day
- [x] Call provider if you gain 3 lbs in a day or 5 lbs in a week

**Rationale**:
> Daily weights are the best indicator of fluid status. NSAIDs (Ibuprofen) cause sodium retention and are contraindicated in HF.

---

## Mission 9: The Fainting Gardener: Aortic Stenosis (M-009)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse auscultates the patient's heart sounds. Differentiate the murmurs based on location and timing.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Systolic Murmur at Right 2nd ICS | **Aortic Stenosis** |
| Systolic Murmur at Apex (radiation to axilla) | **Mitral Regurgitation** |
| Diastolic Murmur at Left Sternal Border | **Aortic Regurgitation** |
| Continuous machine-like murmur | **Patent Ductus Arteriosus** |

**Rationale**:
> Aortic Stenosis is a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the aortic area (R 2nd ICS). Mitral Regurgitation is a pansystolic murmur at the apex. Aortic Regurgitation is a diastolic decrescendo murmur.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Ms. Stewart is admitted for TAVR workup. Which nursing interventions are appropriate for her safety? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Instruct to change positions slowly (dangle legs)
- [x] Maintain strict intake and output

**Rationale**:
> Patients with fixed outlet obstruction (AS) are preload dependent. Nitroglycerin causes vasodilation, dropping preload and potentially causing fatal hypotension/syncope. Vigorous exercise increases demand that the heart cannot meet. Valsalva reduces preload.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient reports chest pressure (Angina). The nurse prepares to act.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Aortic Stenosis Demand Ischemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer Oxygen
  - Place in Semi-Fowlers
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Blood Pressure
  - ST segments

**Rationale**:
> In AS, the hypertrophied muscle needs more oxygen, but the valve limits flow. Nitro is risky! Oxygen increases supply. Rest (Semi-Fowlers) decreases demand. BP must be preserved to push blood through the stenotic valve.

---

## Mission 10: The Friction Rub: Acute Pericarditis (M-010)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Differentiate Pericarditis from Myocardial Infarction based on clinical presentation.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Pain relieved by Nitroglycerin | **Myocardial Infarction** |
| Pain relieved by Leaning Forward | **Pericarditis** |
| ST Elevation is diffuse (all leads) | **Pericarditis** |
| ST Elevation is localized (Coronary territory) | **Myocardial Infarction** |
| Radiation to left arm/jaw | **Myocardial Infarction** |

**Rationale**:
> Pericarditis pain is positional and pleuritic (inflammatory). MI pain is ischemic and often radiates. Diffuse vs Localized ST elevation is the key EKG discriminator.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which medications does the nurse anticipate administering? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Ibuprofen 600mg PO TID
- [x] Colchicine 0.6mg PO BID

**Rationale**:
> High dose NSAIDs (Ibuprofen/Aspirin) are first line. Colchicine is added to reduce recurrence. Steroids (Prednisone) are second-line as they increase recurrence risk. Anticoagulants (Heparin) are contraindicated due to risk of hemopericardium (bleeding into the sac).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient suddenly develops jugular venous distention, muffled heart sounds, and hypotension. Prioritize the complication.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cardiac Tamponade
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prepare for Pericardiocentesis
  - Administer IV Fluid Bolus
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Pulsus Paradoxus
  - Urine Output

**Rationale**:
> Beck's Triad (JVD, Muffled Sounds, Hypotension) confirms Tamponade. The fluid compresses the heart. Pericardiocentesis (draining the fluid) is the cure. IV fluids maximize preload to maintain output temporarily. Pulsus Paradoxus (drop in SBP > 10 during inspiration) is the classic sign.

---

## Mission 11: The Silent Squeeze: NSTEMI (M-011)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Differentiate NSTEMI from STEMI and Unstable Angina based on the findings.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Elevated Troponin | **NSTEMI** |
| ST-Segment Elevation | **STEMI** |
| ST-Segment Depression / T-wave Inversion | **NSTEMI** |
| Chest Pain at Rest | **NSTEMI** |
| Full Thickness Myocardial Damage | **STEMI** |

**Rationale**:
> NSTEMI and STEMI both have positive troponins (cell death). STEMI has ST Elevation (full thickness blockage). NSTEMI has Depression/Inversion (partial blockage). Unstable Angina has pain but NEGATIVE troponins.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient has an allergy to Aspirin (GI Upset). Which actions are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Administer Clopidogrel (Plavix) as alternative
- [x] Administer Heparin Drip
- [x] Administer Nitroglycerin SL

**Rationale**:
> GI Upset is an intolerance, not anaphylaxis, but typically if severe, we switch to Plavix (Clopidogrel). Heparin prevents clot growth. Nitro dilates coronaries. We generally don't force Aspirin if the patient reports bad reactions unless the provider overrides.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The patient's pain increases to 10/10 despite 3 nitroglycerins. BP drops to 88/50. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Right Ventricular Infarction
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer IV Fluid Bolus
  - Obtain Right-Sided ECG
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - BP Response to Fluids
  - Jugular Venous Distention

**Rationale**:
> Inferior/Posterior mis (leads II, III, aVF) often involve the Right Ventricle. RV infarcts are PRELOAD DEPENDENT. Nitro drops preload and causes hypotension. The treatment is FLUIDS to push blood through the right side.

---

## Mission 12: Disconnected: Complete Heart Block (M-012)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Identify the type of AV Block based on the description.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| PR interval constant, dropping QRS occasionally | **2nd Degree Type II** |
| PR interval lengthens until QRS drops | **2nd Degree Type I (Wenckebach)** |
| Complete dissociation of P and QRS | **3rd Degree (Complete)** |
| PR interval > 0.20s, no dropped beats | **1st Degree** |
| Ventricular rate approx 20-40 bpm | **3rd Degree (Complete)** |

**Rationale**:
> 3rd degree block is a complete divorce between Atria and Ventricles. The ventricles rely on a slow escape rhythm (20-40 bpm). Wenckebach gives a warning (lengthening PR). Type II drops without warning.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse acts on the bradycardia. Which interventions are indicated? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Apply Transcutaneous Pacing Pads
- [x] Administer Atropine 1mg IV
- [x] Prepare for Transvenous Pacer insertion
- [x] Start Dopamine infusion

**Rationale**:
> Pacing is the definitive treatment for 3rd degree block. Atropine *may* be tried but often fails in high blocks. Dopamine increases heart rate/BP. Adenosine/Metoprolol slow the heart further and are CONTRAINDICATED.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Ms. Rigby becomes unresponsive. No palpable pulse. Monitor shows the same rhythm (PEA). Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Start CPR
  - Administer Epinephrine 1mg
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Rhythm Check q2 mins
  - End-Tidal CO2

**Rationale**:
> PEA is a rhythm on the monitor but NO pulse. You CANNOT shock PEA. You must do CPR and give Epi. H's and T's (Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, etc.) must be ruled out.

---

## Mission 13: The Leaky Valve: Mitral Regurgitation (M-013)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Correlate the pathophysiology of Mitral Regurgitation with the clinical findings.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Blood flows backward from LV to LA | **Cause of Murmur** |
| Increased pressure in Pulmonary Veins | **Cause of Dyspnea/Crackles** |
| Dilation of Left Atrium | **Risk for AFib** |
| Decreased Cardiac Output | **Cause of Fatigue** |

**Rationale**:
> The leak (murmur) causes backflow into the LA, which backs up into lungs (dyspnea). The stretched LA disrupts electrical pathways (AFib). The forward flow is reduced (Fatigue).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Mr. Jones is scheduled for Mitral Valve Repair. Which pre-op orders are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Administer Furosemide (Lasix) for fluid overload
- [x] Administer Warfarin (Coumadin) for AFib
- [x] Dental clearance exam

**Rationale**:
> Diuretics manage the heart failure symptoms. Anticoagulation prevents stroke from AFib. Dental clearance is MANDATORY before valve surgery to prevent Endocarditis from oral bacteria. Antibiotics are given *intra-op*, not days before.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Post-op, Mr. Jones has a mechanical valve. He asks about his lifestyle. Prioritize the education.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Mechanical Valve Management
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Lifelong Warfarin Therapy
  - Antibiotic Prophylaxis for dental work
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - INR 2.5 - 3.5
  - Clicking sound (Normal)

**Rationale**:
> Mechanical valves last forever but clot easily. They require LIFELONG Warfarin with a higher INR target (2.5-3.5). The valve makes a distinct 'clicking' sound. Antibiotic prophylaxis is needed for invasive procedures.

## Mission 14: The Ticking Time Bomb: AAA (M-014)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse assesses the patient. Identify signs of Rupture vs Stable Aneurysm.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Pulsatile abdominal mass | **Stable / Intact AAA** |
| Sudden severe back/flank pain | **Ruptured AAA / Emergency** |
| Hypotension / Tachycardia | **Ruptured AAA / Emergency** |
| Systolic Bruit | **Stable / Intact AAA** |
| Grey Turner's Sign (Flank Ecchymosis) | **Ruptured AAA / Emergency** |

**Rationale**:
> A stable AAA presents with a mass and bruit. Rupture causes massive internal bleeding -> Shock (Low BP, High HR), severe tearing pain, and bruising on the flanks (Grey Turner's).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The AAA is 5.8 cm (surgical threshold). Mr. Eastwood is pre-op. What are the priority actions? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Control Blood Pressure (Keep SBP < 120)
- [x] Assess peripheral pulses (Femoral, Popliteal, Pedal)
- [x] Keep patient calm / strict bedrest
- [x] Screen for renal function (Creatinine)

**Rationale**:
> Priority #1: Prevent rupture by lowering BP (Anti-impulse therapy). DEEP PALPATION IS CONTRAINDICATED (can rupture it). Pulses establish a baseline. Renal function is key as the repair involves clamping above renal arteries.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Post-EVAR (Endovascular Repair), the patient's urine output drops to 10ml/hr and BP rises to 190/100. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Graft Migration / Renal Occlusion
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Notify Surgeon Immediately
  - Administer IV Labetalol
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Serum Creatinine
  - Pedal Pulses

**Rationale**:
> A sudden drop in urine output post-AAA repair suggests the stent graft may have migrated and covered the renal arteries. This is a SURGICAL EMERGENCY. High BP puts stress on the graft site and must be controlled (Labetalol). Creatinine confirms renal hit.

---

## Mission 15: The Spiked T-Wave: Hyperkalemia (M-015)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Prioritize the medications for Hyperkalemia based on their mechanism of action.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Calcium Gluconate | **Stabilize Cardiac Membrane (Immediate Protection)** |
| Regular Insulin IV + Dextrose | **Shift K+ Into Cells (Temporary)** |
| Albuterol Nebulizer | **Shift K+ Into Cells (Temporary)** |
| Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Kayexalate) | **Excrete K+ from Body (Permanent)** |
| Furosemide (Lasix) | **Excrete K+ from Body (Permanent)** |

**Rationale**:
> Remember 'C Big K Drop'. Calcium protects the heart (FIRST priority if EKG changes). Insulin/Albuterol hide K+ in the cell. Kayexalate/Lasix/Dialysis actually remove it.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse prepares the Insulin/Dextrose cocktail. Which safety checks are required? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Verify Regular Insulin (Not NPH/Lantus)
- [x] Check Blood Glucose prior to administration
- [x] Push Dextrose slowly to avoid vein irritation
- [x] Monitor BG every hour after administration

**Rationale**:
> Only Regular insulin can be given IV. Dextrose is given WITH insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Vein irritation is common with D50. Hypoglycemia is the main risk, so hourly checks are mandatory.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Despite meds, the QRS widens to 0.20s and heart rate drops to 30. Patient loses consciousness. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cardiac Arrest (V-Fib/Asystole)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Start CPR
  - Emergency Dialysis
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Pulse Check
  - Potassium Level

**Rationale**:
> Widening QRS signals impending sine-wave and asystole. Meds failed. CRP keeps him alive until Dialysis (the only thing that will pull the K+ fast enough) can be started. This is a Code Blue situation.

---

## Mission 16: The Failing Pump: Cardiogenic Shock (M-016)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Distinguish Cardiogenic Shock from Hypovolemic Shock based on the findings.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Low Blood Pressure | **Both** |
| High Heart Rate | **Both** |
| Pulmonary Crackles / High PCWP | **Cardiogenic Shock** |
| Flat Jugular Veins | **Hypovolemic Shock** |
| Cold/Clammy Skin | **Both** |

**Rationale**:
> Both shocks cause low BP/high HR/cold skin. The differentiator is FLUID STATUS. Cardiogenic is WET (Crackles, High Wedge). Hypovolemic is DRY (Flat veins, Low Wedge).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The provider orders Dobutamine. Which actions are consistent with this therapy? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Monitor for ventricular arrhythmias (PVCs/VT)
- [x] Titrate to keep SBP > 90 mmHg
- [x] Administer via central line if possible

**Rationale**:
> Dobutamine is an inotrope (squeuzer). It INCREASES contractility but can irritate the heart (arrhythmias). It is a vesicant (central line preferred). Beta blockers would oppose its effect.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Despite Dobutamine, BP drops to 70/40. The patient is obtunded. Prioritize the next level of support.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Refractory Cardiogenic Shock
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prepare for Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP)
  - Administer Epinephrine
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Pedal Pulses (Limb Ischemia)
  - Bowel Sounds

**Rationale**:
> Medical management failed. The heart needs mechanical help. IABP reduces afterload and increases coronary perfusion. Fluids kill this patient (lungs are full). Epi (Levophed preferred) may be needed for severe hypotension. IABP carries risk of limb ischemia.

---

## Mission 17: The Painful Walk: PAD (M-017)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Detailed assessment of the legs. Classify findings as Arterial (PAD) or Venous (PVD).

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Pain worsens with elevation | **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)** |
| Pain improves with elevation | **Peripheral Venous Disease (PVD)** |
| Skin is cool/pale | **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)** |
| Skin is warm/brown/edematous | **Peripheral Venous Disease (PVD)** |
| Ulcers on toes (punched out) | **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)** |
| Ulcers on ankles (irregular borders) | **Peripheral Venous Disease (PVD)** |

**Rationale**:
> Arterial = Problem getting blood DOWN (Gravity helps, Elevation hurts). Venous = Problem getting blood UP (Elevation helps, Gravity hurts).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which instructions are appropriate for Mr. Ranger? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Walk until pain starts, rest, then walk again
- [x] Monitor feet daily for injuries/sores
- [x] Avoid crossing legs
- [x] Smoking cessation is critical

**Rationale**:
> Heating pads are dangerous due to decreased sensation (burn risk). Compression stockings constrict arteries further (contraindicated in PAD, good for Venous). Walking builds collateral circulation. Crossing legs obstructs flow.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Mr. Ranger calls reporting his right foot is suddenly cold, numb, and 'white'. He cannot move his toes. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Acute Arterial Occlusion
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prepare for Embolectomy/Thrombolysis
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - The 6 P's (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness...)

**Rationale**:
> This is the '6 P's' emergency. A clot has completely blocked the artery. The limb will die in hours without blood. Immediate surgical (embolectomy) or medical (TPA) intervention is needed. Elevation makes ischemia WORSE.

---

## Mission 18: Cold Hands: Buerger's & Raynaud's (M-018)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Compare Raynaud's Phenomenon vs Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans).

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Review of Systems: Vasospasm triggered by cold/stress | **Both** |
| Review of Systems: Inflammation/Clotting of small vessels | **Buerger's** |
| Strongly associated with Autoimmune (Lupus) | **Raynaud's** |
| Strongly associated with Smoking | **Buerger's** |
| Can lead to amputation | **Buerger's** |

**Rationale**:
> Raynaud's is a functional spasm (rarely causes tissue loss unless severe). Buerger's is an inflammatory clotting disease EXCLUSIVELY linked to smoking that destroys distal vessels.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient asks how to save his fingers. Which instructions are valid? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] You MUST stop smoking completely (even patches/gum are bad)
- [x] Wear gloves when reaching into the freezer
- [x] Move to a warmer climate
- [x] Stress management techniques
- [x] Take Calcium Channel Blockers (Nifedipine) as prescribed

**Rationale**:
> For Buerger's, total nicotine cessation is the ONLY cure. Even NRT (patches) can perpetuate it. Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor (avoid!). CCBs prevent vasospasm.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Mr. Snow presents with throbbing pain in his hand. The finger is black and smells foul. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Wet Gangrene
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prepare for Amputation
  - Administer IV Antibiotics
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Sepsis signs (Fever, BP)

**Rationale**:
> Wet gangrene (foul smell, black) implies infection on top of dead tissue. This is a sepsis risk. The dead tissue must be removed (amputation). Antibiotics cover the infection.

---

## Mission 19: The Tearing Pain: Aortic Dissection (M-019)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Compare Myocardial Infarction vs Aortic Dissection presentation.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Pain Description: 'Crushing / Elephant on chest' | **Myocardial Infarction** |
| Pain Description: 'Tearing / Ripping / Shearing' | **Aortic Dissection** |
| Radiation to Jaw/Arm | **Myocardial Infarction** |
| Radiation to Back/Scapula | **Aortic Dissection** |
| BP asymmetry (>20mmHg difference between arms) | **Aortic Dissection** |

**Rationale**:
> The hallmark of dissection is 'tearing' pain to the back and unequal BPs (because the tear blocks flow to one subclavian artery).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The diagnosis is Type A Dissection (Surgical Emergency). While waiting for the OR, what are the nursing priorities? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Administer IV Esmolol (Beta Blocker)
- [x] Administer IV Nitroprusside (Vasodilator)
- [x] Maintain SBP 100-110 mmHg
- [x] Maintain HR < 60 bpm

**Rationale**:
> We must reduce shear stress (dP/dt). Beta blockers (Esmolol) are given FIRST to lower heart rate. Then Vasodilators (Nitroprusside) to lower BP. If you give Nitro first, reflex tachycardia will tear the aorta further. Heparin causes fatal bleeding.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Suddenly, BP drops to 60/40, JVD appears, and heart sounds become muffled. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cardiac Tamponade (Rupture)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Immediate Thoracotomy / Pericardiocentesis
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - ECG voltage (Electrical Alternans)

**Rationale**:
> The dissection has ruptured retrograde into the pericardium (Tamponade). This is usually fatal without instant drainage/repair. Beck's triad (JVD, Hypotension, Muffled sounds) is the key.

---

## Mission 20: The Vegetation: Infective Endocarditis (M-020)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Match the dermatological sign to its description.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Painful, raised red nodes on finger pads | **Osler's Nodes** |
| Painless flat red spots on palms/soles | **Janeway Lesions** |
| Linear dark streaks under fingernails | **Splinter Hemorrhages** |
| Retinal hemorrhages with pale centers | **Roth Spots** |

**Rationale**:
> Oslers = Ouch (Painful/Immune complex). Janeway = Painless (Embolic). Splinter = Embolic. Roth = Embolic/Immunologic.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which orders are priority for this patient? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Start IV Vancomycin (after cultures)
- [x] Consult Cardiac Surgery
- [x] Monitor for signs of Pulmonary Embolism
- [x] Place PICC Line for long-term antibiotics

**Rationale**:
> MRSA requires Vancomycin. Tricuspid vegetations embolize to the LUNGS (PE), not the brain (Stroke), because it's on the right side. Surgery consult is needed for large vegetations. Treatment is 4-6 weeks, so a PICC is needed (though risky in IVDA, it's necessary).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Patient develops sudden shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. SpO2 drops to 88%. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Septic Emboli to Lungs (PE)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer Oxygen
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Respiratory Rate

**Rationale**:
> Right-sided endocarditis (Tricuspid, common in IVDA) shoots emboli to the lungs. This causes septic pulmonary emboli. Oxygen is priority. Anticoagulation (Heparin) is controversial/contraindicated in infective endocarditis due to cerebral bleed risk (mycotic aneurysm).

---

## Mission 21: The Sweet Coma: HHS Management (M-021)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The nurse reviews the lab results. Differentiate HHS from DKA based on Ms. Williams' presentation.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Blood Glucose > 600 mg/dL | **Both** |
| Presence of Serum Ketones | **DKA** |
| Acidosis (pH < 7.35) | **DKA** |
| Profound Dehydration (>10L deficit) | **HHS** |
| Mental Status Changes (Coma/Stupor) | **HHS** |

**Rationale**:
> HHS (Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State) is characterized by extreme hyperglycemia (>600) and hyperosmolarity (>320) leading to profound dehydration and neurological changes. Unlike DKA, there is enough circulating insulin to prevent ketosis/acidosis.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which orders does the nurse anticipate for initial resuscitation? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Start IV Fluids (0.9% NS) at 1L/hr
- [x] Administer IV Regular Insulin Bolus (0.1 units/kg)
- [x] Monitor Potassium levels hourly
- [x] Insert Foley Catheter

**Rationale**:
> Fluid resuscitation is the absolute priority to fix the hyperosmolarity. IV Insulin is used to lower BG. Potassium must be monitored as insulin shifts K+ into cells. A Foley is needed to track output accurately during massive fluid replacement.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: During treatment, the patient becomes responsive but complains of muscle cramps. Her K+ drops to 3.2 mEq/L. Prioritize the plan.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Hypokalemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Hold Insulin Infusion
  - Add Potassium Chloride to IV Fluids
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Continuous EKG
  - Fingerstick Glucose

**Rationale**:
> Insulin drives Potassium into the cell. If K+ drops below 3.3, insulin MUST be held to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias (VT/VF). Repletion (IV KCl) is urgent. EKG provides real-time monitoring of cardiac stability.

---

## Mission 22: The Rule of 15: Acute Hypoglycemia (M-022)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Classify the patient's symptoms as Adrenergic (catecholamine release) or Neuroglycopenic (brain glucose deprivation).

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Tremors / Shaking | **Adrenergic (Warning Signs)** |
| Confusion / Difficulty Concentrating | **Neuroglycopenic (Late Signs)** |
| Diaphoresis (Sweating) | **Adrenergic (Warning Signs)** |
| Tachycardia (Palpitations) | **Adrenergic (Warning Signs)** |
| Slurred Speech / Drowsiness | **Neuroglycopenic (Late Signs)** |

**Rationale**:
> The body releases epinephrine to raise BG, causing shaking/sweating/tachycardia. If uncorrected, the brain runs out of fuel, causing confusion/coma (Neuroglycopenia).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Ben is conscious and can swallow. Which food items serve as appropriate '15g' rapid-acting carbohydrates? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] 4 oz (1/2 cup) Apple Juice
- [x] 1 tablespoon of Honey
- [x] 3-4 Glucose Tablets

**Rationale**:
> Treatment requires simple sugars. Diet soda has no sugar. Chocolate and Bagels contain fat/protein which delays absorption.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Ben's roommate finds him later unconscious and unable to swallow. BG is 30 mg/dL. Prioritize the emergency response.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Severe Hypoglycemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer IM Glucagon
  - Call 911
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Airway/Aspiration risk
  - Return of Consciousness

**Rationale**:
> An unconscious patient is an aspiration risk; NEVER put anything in their mouth. IM Glucagon mobilizes liver glycogen. 911 is needed. Monitoring airway (side-lying position) is critical due to vomiting risk from Glucagon.

---

## Mission 23: Tech Failure: Insulin Pump Malfunction (M-023)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Troubleshoot the pump failure. Match the potential cause to the component.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Cannula kinked under skin | **Infusion Site Issue** |
| Tubing caught in door/zipper | **Mechanical/Tubing Issue** |
| Reservoir empty | **Mechanical/Tubing Issue** |
| Battery dead | **Device Power Issue** |
| Bad absorption (Scar tissue) | **Infusion Site Issue** |

**Rationale**:
> Systematic troubleshooting: Check the Site (kinks, infection), the Line (air bubbles, clogs), and the Pump (battery, settings).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The pump is confirmed to be malfunctioning. What are the priority actions to prevent DKA? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Disconnect the pump immediately
- [x] Administer a correction bolus via syringe/pen (Manual injection)
- [x] Change the infusion set and new site rotation
- [x] Check for ketones

**Rationale**:
> Manual insulin is required to fix the high BG immediately because the pump is unreliable. Disconnecting prevents accidental bolus if it suddenly works. Ketones confirm insulin deficiency.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Ketones are positive. The patient needs a backup plan while the pump is off. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Pump Failure
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Give stat Long-Acting Insulin (Glargine)
  - Give stat Rapid-Acting Insulin (Lispro)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - BG every 2 hours
  - Ketones every void

**Rationale**:
> Only Short-acting insulin is in the pump. When disconnected, the patient has NO basal insulin. They need manual Long-Acting (Basal) and Rapid-Acting (Bolus) to survive until the pump is replaced. Monitoring for ketone clearance is vital.

## Mission 24: Morning Highs: Somogyi vs Dawn (M-024)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Interpret the cause of morning hyperglycemia based on the 3AM check.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| 3AM Glucose is Low (< 70) | **Somogyi Effect** |
| 3AM Glucose is Normal/High (> 100) | **Dawn Phenomenon** |
| Patient reports Night Sweats / Nightmares | **Somogyi Effect** |
| Caused by rebound hormone release (Glucagon/Epi) | **Somogyi Effect** |
| Caused by natural Growth Hormone release | **Dawn Phenomenon** |

**Rationale**:
> Somogyi = Rebound hyperglycemia following nocturnal hypoglycemia (Low at 3AM). The body panic-dumps sugar. Dawn = Natural circadian rhythm GH release causing insulin resistance (High/Normal at 3AM). Night sweats are a sign of hypoglycemia.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Based on the diagnosis of Somogyi Effect, which interventions are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Decrease the bedtime NPH dose
- [x] Add a protein-heavy bedtime snack
- [x] Check BG at 3 AM for the next few nights

**Rationale**:
> The problem is Hypoglycemia while sleeping. We need to prevent the drop. Decreasing the insulin or adding a snack helps carry the sugar through the night. Increasing the dose (which the patient did) worsens the effect.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: A month later, Gary returns. His 3AM BG is now 140, but his morning fasting is 180. Prioritize the new plan.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Dawn Phenomenon
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Increase Bedtime NPH
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Fasting Morning Glucose
  - 3AM Glucose

**Rationale**:
> If the 3AM blood sugar is normal/high, and morning is high, it is Dawn Phenomenon (not enough insulin to cover the GH surge). The treatment is to INCREASE the insulin to cover the dawn rise.

---

## Mission 25: Flu Season: Sick Day Rules (M-025)

### Step 1: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse educates Tina on 'Sick Day Rules'. Which instructions are vital? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] NEVER stop taking your insulin, even if not eating
- [x] Check blood glucose every 3-4 hours
- [x] Check urine ketones if BG > 240 mg/dL
- [x] Force fluids (4-6 oz every 30 mins) to prevent dehydration
- [x] If you cannot eat solid food, drink sugar-containing liquids (juice/gatorade) to maintain BG

**Rationale**:
> Illness increases cortisol, which raises BG even without food. Hydration is key to flushing ketones. Carbohydrates are still needed to prevent starvation ketosis, so liquid calories are used if solids aren't tolerated. Fever alone isn't an ER trip unless persistent/high.

### Step 2: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Tina asks when she needs to call the doctor or go to the ER. Classify the scenarios.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Vomiting more than once / unable to verify fluids | **Call Provider / Seek Emergency Care** |
| Blood Glucose > 250 for > 24 hours despite extra insulin | **Call Provider / Seek Emergency Care** |
| Moderate to Large Ketones in urine | **Call Provider / Seek Emergency Care** |
| Temperature of 100.5 F | **Continue Sick Day Management at Home** |
| Confusion or heavy breathing (Kussmaul) | **Call Provider / Seek Emergency Care** |

**Rationale**:
> Inability to keep fluids down is an emergency (DKA risk). Moderate/Large ketones indicate impending DKA. Mild fever is expected with flu.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Tina calls back 6 hours later. She can't stop vomiting and feels 'breathless'. Prioritize the complication.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Advise to go to ER immediately
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Anion Gap / ABG

**Rationale**:
> Persistent vomiting + Breathlessness (Kussmaul) + T1DM = DKA until proven otherwise. Home management has failed. She needs IV fluids and insulin. We monitor the Anion Gap to gauge acidosis severity.

---

## Mission 26: Sugar for Two: Gestational Diabetes (M-026)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: The patient is diagnosed with GDM. Assess the risks to the Fetus vs the Mother.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Macrosomia (Large size) | **Fetal Risk** |
| Neonatal Hypoglycemia | **Fetal Risk** |
| Type 2 Diabetes later in life | **Both** |
| Pre-eclampsia | **Maternal Risk** |
| Shoulder Dystocia (Birth Injury) | **Fetal Risk** |

**Rationale**:
> High sugar crosses the placenta (fat baby), but insulin does NOT. The baby makes its own insulin, leading to hypoglycemia at birth. Mom is at risk for Pre-eclampsia and future T2DM.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Maria asks about diet changes. Which instructions are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Eat 3 meals and 3 snacks spaced evenly
- [x] Monitor ketones in morning urine
- [x] Bedtime snack should include protein

**Rationale**:
> We NEVER restrict calories to cause weight loss in pregnancy (ketosis hurts the baby). We spread carbs out to prevent spikes. Protein at bedtime prevents morning hypoglycemia.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Post-delivery, the baby weighs 10lbs 5oz. At 1 hour of life, the baby is jittery and lethargic. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Neonatal Hypoglycemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Breastfeed immediately
  - Check Heelstick Glucose
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Temperature
  - Rooting Reflex

**Rationale**:
> The baby's pancreas is pumping out insulin to handle Mom's sugar. Now that the cord is cut, the sugar supply is gone, but the insulin remains. Result: Crash. Feed immediately to neutralize the insulin.

---

## Mission 27: Recess Emergency: Pediatric T1DM (M-027)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Compare the 'Honeymoon Phase' vs 'Diagnosis' in Type 1 Diabetes.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Pancreas produces NO insulin | **Diagnosis Phase** |
| Pancreas produces SOME insulin temporarily | **Honeymoon Phase** |
| Insulin requirements decrease drastically | **Honeymoon Phase** |
| Risk of DKA is highest | **Diagnosis Phase** |
| Occurs shortly after starting insulin therapy | **Honeymoon Phase** |

**Rationale**:
> After starting insulin, the rested pancreas may sputter out a last bit of insulin (Honeymoon), making control easy. Parents think 'he's cured'. He is not. It will fail completely soon.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Timmy is ready for school. What must be in his backpack? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Glucagon Emergency Kit
- [x] Snacks (Granola bar/Juice box)
- [x] Insulin Pen
- [x] Blood Glucose Meter

**Rationale**:
> T1DM kids MUST participate in Gym (exercise helps), but they need snacks to prevent lows. Glucagon is for emergencies. Sharps are usually kept in the nurse's office, not the backpack (safety).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: At a birthday party, Timmy eats cake and plays tag. He gets shaky and pale. BG is 60. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Exercise-Induced Hypoglycemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Give 4oz Juice
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Recheck BG in 15 mins

**Rationale**:
> Exercise increases insulin sensitivity + Cake bolus = Mismatch. Consuming simple sugar (Juice) is the Rule of 15. Glucagon is only if unconscious. Recheck in 15 mins.

---

## Mission 28: The Hidden Nail: Neuropathy (M-028)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Differentiate Neuropathic Pain vs Ischemic Pain in the diabetic foot.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Burning / Tingling / Electric Shocks | **Neuropathic** |
| Pain with walking (Claudication) | **Ischemic** |
| Worse at night (under covers) | **Neuropathic** |
| Relieved by dangling legs | **Ischemic** |
| Loss of sensation (Numbness) | **Neuropathic** |

**Rationale**:
> Neuropathy is nerve damage (burning/numbness). Ischemia is blood flow block (pain with demand). Dan has neuropathy (didn't feel the nail).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The nurse teaches foot care. Which statements by Lt. Dan indicate understanding? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] I will use a mirror to inspect the bottom of my feet daily.
- [x] I will never walk barefoot, even at home.
- [x] I will shake out my shoes before putting them on.

**Rationale**:
> Soaking softens skin (bad). Hot water burns (he can't feel it). Cutting rounded causes ingrown nails (cut straight across). Lotion between toes causes fungus (Athlete's foot).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The redness spreads up the calf. Fever 102 F. BG 350. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Sepsis 2/2 Osteomyelitis
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Start IV Broad Spectrum Abx
  - Blood Cultures x2
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Lactate Level
  - WBC Trend

**Rationale**:
> Ascending redness + Fever = Systemic Infection (Sepsis). Osteomyelitis is hard to cure. Antibiotics and Debridement are key. Lactate tracks sepsis severity.

## Mission 29: Blurred Lines: Retinopathy (M-029)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Match the eye complication to the symptom.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Curtain falling over vision / Flashes of light | **Retinal Detachment** |
| Cloudy / Blurry vision (gradual) | **Cataracts** |
| Central vision loss (wavy lines) | **Macular Degeneration** |
| Tunnel vision (peripheral loss) | **Glaucoma** |
| Floating spots / Spiderwebs | **Vitreous Hemorrhage** |

**Rationale**:
> High sugar damages vessels --> New weak vessels grow (Neovascularization) --> They bleed (Hemorrhage/Floaters) or pull the retina off (Detachment/Curtain).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Mr. Wonder is scheduled for Vitrectomy. Which pre-op instructions are vital? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] You must stop anticoagulant medications
- [x] Control blood pressure strictly
- [x] Avoid heavy lifting or straining (Valsalva)
- [x] Eye drops will be needed for weeks

**Rationale**:
> Bleeding is the enemy. BP and straining increase ocular pressure. Face-down positioning is for gas bubbles (often used, but straining/BP are universal priorities).

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Post-op, he complains of severe pain and nausea. Eye is rock hard. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Acute Glaucoma (IOP spike)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer IV Mannitol
  - Keep head of bed elevated
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Intraocular Pressure

**Rationale**:
> Severe pain + Nausea + 'Rock Hard' Eye = Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma. The drainage is blocked. Mannitol draws fluid out. Elevation helps drain. This causes permanent blindness if not fixed.

## Mission 30: The Contrast Clash: Lactic Acidosis (M-030)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Analyze the drug-drug/disease interaction.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Metformin mechanism | **Increases Glucose Uptake** |
| IV Contrast effect | **Causes Vasoconstriction/AKI** |
| Result of combination | **Inhibits Lactate clearance** |
| Kidney's role | **Excretes Metformin** |

**Rationale**:
> Contrast dye hurts the kidneys (AKI). The kidneys excrete Metformin. If kidneys fail, Metformin builds up to toxic levels. Metformin blocks the liver from recycling lactate. Result: Lactic Acidosis.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which interventions are appropriate for Lactic Acidosis? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] IV Sodium Bicarbonate (if pH < 7.1)
- [x] Hemodialysis
- [x] Fluid Resuscitation
- [x] Stop Metformin indefinitely
- [x] Administer Acetylcysteine (Mucomyst)

**Rationale**:
> Dialysis is the most effective way to remove both the Metformin and the Acid. Fluids flush the kidneys. Mucomyst protects kidneys from contrast (though late now). Insulin is for DKA, not Lactic Acidosis.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Mr. Lee's pH drops to 7.10. He becomes bradycardic. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Refractory Acidosis / Cardiac Instability
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Emergent Dialysis
  - Intubate and Hyperventilate
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Potassium (Correction of acidosis shifts K)
  - BP

**Rationale**:
> Severe acidosis stops the heart (denatures proteins/enzymes). Dialysis is the only fix. Hyperventilation (mechanical) helps blow off CO2 to compensate for the metabolic acid.

## Mission 31: The Fluid War: CHF vs Kidney (M-031)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Evaluate the treatment conflict: Heart vs Kidney.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Administer High-Dose IV Furosemide | **Helps Heart / Hurts Kidney** |
| Administer IV Fluids (NS) | **Helps Kidney / Hurts Heart** |
| Administer ACE Inhibitor (Lisinopril) | **Helps Heart / Hurts Kidney** |
| Administer Spironolactone | **Bad for Both** |

**Rationale**:
> Diuretics offload the heart but can cause pre-renal AKI. Fluids fix the kidney (perfuse it) but drown the heart. ACEs protect the heart remodeling but lower GFR initially. Spironolactone causes Hyperkalemia (K=5.5), so it's bad for this patient.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The provider orders 'Bumex drip'. Which monitoring is essential? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Hourly Urine Output
- [x] Daily Weights
- [x] Monitor Potassium (Hypokalemia)
- [x] Monitor Magnesium
- [x] Monitor BP for hypotension

**Rationale**:
> Strong loop diuretics (Bumetanide) cause massive electrolyte loss (K+, Mg++) and can tank BP. Glucose monitoring isn't strictly q1h for diuretics compared to insulin.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Creatinine jumps to 3.5. Urine output stops (Anuria). Lung sounds wet. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cardiorenal Syndrome
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prepare for Dialysis (CRRT)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Oxygen Saturation
  - Foley Catheter

**Rationale**:
> The kidneys have shut down (Anuria) despite/because of heart treatment. Diuretics won't work if kidneys can't filter. CRRT (Continuous Dialysis) is needed to pull fluid without crashing BP.

## Mission 32: The Masked Threat: Beta Blockers (M-032)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Evaluate the signs of Hypoglycemia in a patient on Beta Blockers.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Tachycardia (Palpitations) | **Masked/Blocked by Metoprolol** |
| Tremors / Shaking | **Masked/Blocked by Metoprolol** |
| Diaphoresis (Sweating) | **NOT Blocked (Still visible)** |
| Hunger | **NOT Blocked (Still visible)** |
| Anxiety | **Masked/Blocked by Metoprolol** |

**Rationale**:
> Beta blockers block the sympathetic 'fight or flight' response (High HR, Shaking). They do NOT block Cholinergic symptoms like Sweating and Hunger. The patient must rely on sweating as their warning sign.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: What teaching is CRITICAL for this patient? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] You must check your blood sugar more frequently, especially before driving
- [x] If you sweat excessively, check your sugar immediately
- [x] Carry a glucagon kit and glucose tabs

**Rationale**:
> Since the early warning system (palpitations) is broken, frequent checking is the only safety net. Sweating is the one reliable sign left. Never stop cardiac meds abruptly.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Mr. Banner's HR drops to 40 and BG is 45. He is conscious. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Severe Hypoglycemia with Bradycardia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Administer IV D50W / Oral Glucose
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Blood Glucose Re-check
  - Heart Rate Recovery

**Rationale**:
> Hypoglycemia must be treated first. Unlike non-BB patients, his HR won't spike to compensate. Glucagon *might* ensure sugar release but IV D50 is definitive if available. Glucagon is also the antidote for Beta Blocker overdose (increases contractility).

---

## Mission 33: Breath vs Sugar: Steroid Spike (M-033)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Understanding Glucocorticoids. Match the effect to the system.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Increases Liver Gluconeogenesis (Sugar production) | **Adverse Effect (Diabetes)** |
| Increases Insulin Resistance in cells | **Adverse Effect (Diabetes)** |
| Reduces Inflammation in airways | **Desired Effect (Lungs)** |
| Causes Sodium/Water Retention | **Adverse Effect (Heart)** |

**Rationale**:
> Steroids are a double-edged sword. They save the lungs but wreck the sugar control and raise BP (fluid retention).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: How should the nurse adjust the care plan? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Increase frequency of BG checks (q4h or q6h)
- [x] Request increased Insulin coverage (Sliding scale + Basal)
- [x] Monitor for signs of infection (Steroids suppress immune system)

**Rationale**:
> We cannot stop the steroids (breathing is priority). We must chase the sugar with MORE insulin. Infection risk is high due to hyperglycemia + immune suppression.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Mr. Vader becomes confused and develops deep, rapid breathing. Ketones are Trace. Glucose 550. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: HHS
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Start IV Insulin Infusion
  - IV Fluids 0.9% NS
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Serum Osmolality
  - pH

**Rationale**:
> High sugar + Confusion + Trace Ketones (not large) favors HHS, though DKA is possible. Steroids push T2DM into HHS territory. Hydration and Insulin are the fix.

## Mission 34: Cheap & Effective: Thiazide Risks (M-034)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Identify the metabolic side effects of Thiazide Diuretics.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Effect on Blood Glucose | **Increases (Hyper)** |
| Effect on Uric Acid | **Increases (Hyper)** |
| Effect on Potassium | **Decreases (Hypo)** |
| Effect on Calcium | **Increases (Hyper)** |
| Effect on Lipids (Cholesterol) | **Increases (Hyper)** |

**Rationale**:
> HyperGLUC (Glycemia, Lipids, Uric Acid, Calcium). Hypokalemia. HCTZ is cheap but metabolically 'dirty'.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Ms. Pincher has a Sulfa allergy. Which actions are appropriate? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Stop HCTZ immediately
- [x] Monitor for cross-sensitivity reaction
- [x] Prescribe Losartan (ARB) instead

**Rationale**:
> Thiazides are Sulfonamides. While cross-reaction is rare, a rash history makes it risky. ARBs are safe and metabolically neutral. Lasix is ALSO a Sulfa drug!

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Patient develops severe leg cramps and palpitations. EKG shows U-waves. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Hypokalemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Oral Potassium Replacement
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Telemetry / EKG
  - Serum Potassium

**Rationale**:
> Leg cramps + U waves = Hypokalemia (Low K). Thiazides waste potassium. Oral replacement is preferred if stable; IV if unstable/critical.

---

## Mission 35: Sugar in Urine: SGLT2 Risks (M-035)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Evaluate the mechanism of SGLT2 Inhibitors.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Blocks reabsorption of glucose in kidneys | **True** |
| Causes Glycosuria (Sugar in urine) | **True** |
| Increases risk of UTI / Yeast infections | **True** |
| Reduces Heart Failure hospitalizations | **True** |

**Rationale**:
> SGLT2s (Flozins) make you pee out sugar. Sugar loves bacteria/yeast, hence infections. They are miracle drugs for Heart Failure.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient has 'Euglycemic DKA' (DKA with normal-ish sugar). Why? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] The drug lowers blood sugar via urine, masking the severity
- [x] The body is starving for carbs and breaking down fat (Ketones)
- [x] The patient is dehydrated

**Rationale**:
> Euglycemic DKA is a rare but dangerous SGLT2 side effect. The sugar is low (peed out), but the acidosis (ketones) is raging. Providers miss it because the glucometer says '180', not '600'.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: The diagnosis is Euglycemic DKA. Prioritize the plan.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Euglycemic DKA
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Stop SGLT2 Inhibitor
  - Start Insulin Drip + Dextrose
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Anion Gap closure

**Rationale**:
> We must turn off the ketosis with Insulin. But since sugar is already low (180), we MUST give Dextrose (Sugar) WITH the insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. This is counter-intuitive but life-saving.

## Mission 36: The Golden Hour: Sepsis (M-036)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Prioritize the Sepsis Core Measure (1-Hour Bundle).

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Measure Lactate Level | **First 15 Mins** |
| Obtain Blood Cultures | **First 15 Mins** |
| Administer Broad Spectrum Antibiotics | **Within 1 Hour** |
| Administer 30ml/kg Crystalloid Bolus | **Within 1 Hour** |
| Start Vasopressors | **Only if Fluid Resuscitation Fails** |

**Rationale**:
> Lactate and Cultures MUST come first. Antibiotics cannot be given until cultures are drawn (unless delay > 45 mins). Fluids are given concurrently. Pressors are only for refractory hypotension.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient weighs 50kg. The provider orders 30ml/kg Normal Saline. Calculate and implement.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Total Volume = 1500 mL
- [x] Set pump rate to 999 ml/hr (Wide Open)
- [x] Monitor for crackles (Pulmonary Edema)
- [x] Warm the fluids if possible

**Rationale**:
> 50kg * 30ml = 1500ml. This is a BOLUS, meaning give it FAST (999 rate). Warming prevents hypothermia. Lung checks are vital in elderly patients to prevent overload.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: After 1500ml fluid, BP is still 85/50. Lactate is 6.0. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Septic Shock
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Start Norepinephrine (Levophed)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - MAP > 65
  - Urine Output

**Rationale**:
> Fluid refractory hypotension = Septic Shock. The drug of choice is Norepinephrine (Levophed). The goal is Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) > 65 to perfuse organs (Kidneys/Brain).

---

## Mission 37: White Out: ARDS (M-037)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Diagnose ARDS based on the Berlin Criteria.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Timing: Within 1 week of insult | **Met** |
| Chest Imaging: Bilateral Opacities | **Met** |
| Edema Origin: Not fully explained by Heart Failure | **Met** |
| Oxygenation: PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300 | **Met** |

**Rationale**:
> Pancreatitis triggers systemic inflammation -> Leaky lung capillaries -> Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS). P/F ratio = 55 / 1.0 = 55 (Severe ARDS < 100).

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: The patient is intubated. Which ventilator strategies protect the lung? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Low Tidal Volume (6ml/kg PBW)
- [x] High PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure)
- [x] Permissive Hypercapnia (Allowing high CO2)
- [x] Maintain Plateau Pressure < 30 cmH2O

**Rationale**:
> Baby Lungs concept: Use Low Volumes to prevent volutrauma. Use High PEEP to recruit alveoli. Allow CO2 to rise (as long as pH > 7.2) to spare the lungs. Keep pressure low.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: O2 Sat remains 85% despite optimal vent settings. Prioritize the rescue therapy.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Refractory Hypoxemia
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Prone Positioning (Face Down)
  - Administer Neuromuscular Blockade (Paralysis)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - P/F Ratio
  - Train of Four (Twitch monitor)

**Rationale**:
> Proning recruits the posterior lung fields (where most alveoli are). Paralysis (Nimbex) reduces oxygen consumption by muscles. Train of Four ensures they are paralyzed enough but not overdosed.

## Mission 38: The Headache: Pediatric DKA (M-038)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Fluid management in Pediatric DKA is controversial. Weigh the risks.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Rapid bolus of 40ml/kg | **Too Fast (Dangerous)** |
| Slow correction over 48 hours | **Standard Care (Safe)** |
| Risk of Cerebral Edema | **Too Fast (Dangerous)** |
| Risk of Shock | **Standard Care (Safe)** |

**Rationale**:
> In kids, dropping osmolarity too fast creates a gradient where fluid rushes into the brain -> Cerebral Edema (Fatal). We give moderate fluids (10-20ml/kg) and correct slowly.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: Which signs indicate developing Cerebral Edema? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Sudden severe headache
- [x] Bradypnea (respiratory slowing)
- [x] Hypertension with Bradycardia (Cushing's Triad)
- [x] Incontinence
- [x] Fixed dilated pupils

**Rationale**:
> Any neurological deterioration in a DKA kid is Cerebral Edema until proven otherwise. Cushing's Triad is a late sign of herniation.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: Eleven grabs her head, screams, and becomes unresponsive. HR 50. BP 160/90. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cerebral Herniation
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Mannitol IV Push
  - Elevate Head of Bed
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Pupillary Response
  - GCS

**Rationale**:
> Cushing's Triad confirmed. The brain is herniating. We must shrink the brain NOW. Mannitol or 3% Saline draws water out. Elevate head to drain venous blood. Reduce maintenance fluids.

## Mission 39: The Pressure Cooker: HTN Crisis (M-039)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Distinguish Hypertensive Urgency vs Emergency.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| BP > 180/120 | **Both** |
| Evidence of End Organ Damage (Heart, Brain, Kidney) | **Emergency** |
| Requires IV Drip Admission | **Emergency** |
| Treat with Oral agents slowly | **Urgency** |
| Headache alone | **Urgency** |

**Rationale**:
> The number (180/120) is the same. The difference is Organ Damage. Pete has chest pain (Heart) and confusion (Brain), so it is EMERGENCY.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: We start a Nitroprusside drip. What are the rules? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Protect the IV bag from light (Opaque cover)
- [x] Monitor Thiocyanate/Cyanide levels if used > 24hrs
- [x] Lower BP by max 25% in first hour
- [x] Monitor continuous arterial line BP

**Rationale**:
> Nitroprusside turns into CYANIDE in the light/body. Never drop BP too fast (stroke risk from hypoperfusion) - max 25% drop initially. Art line is mandatory for potent vasodilators.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: After 24 hours, Pete becomes confused again and smells like 'bitter almonds'. Lactic acid is rising. Prioritize.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Cyanide Toxicity
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Stop Nitroprusside
  - Administer Sodium Thiosulfate
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Thiocyanate Level
  - Lactate

**Rationale**:
> Bitter almonds + Acidosis on Nitroprusside = Cyanide Poisoning. Stop the drug. Give Thiosulfate (antidote).

---

## Mission 40: Flatline: Code Blue (M-040)

### Step 1: MATRIX
**Prompt**: Review the ACLS Algorithms. Match the treatment to the rhythm.

**Correct Answer**:
| Row | Correct Column |
|---|---|
| Ventricular Fibrillation (V-Fib) | **Shockable** |
| Ventricular Tachycardia (Pulseless) | **Shockable** |
| Asystole (Flatline) | **Not Shockable** |
| PEA (Rhythm but no pulse) | **Not Shockable** |

**Rationale**:
> If they are dead (pulseless), check if the heart is shaking (Fib/Tach). If yes, SHOCK IT. If it's silent (Asystole/PEA), shocking does nothing. Just CPR + Epi.

### Step 2: EXTENDED SATA
**Prompt**: You are running the code. Which actions are High Quality CPR? Select all that apply.

**Correct Answer**:
- [x] Rate 100-120 compressions/min
- [x] Depth at least 2 inches (5cm)
- [x] Allow full chest recoil
- [x] Minimize interruptions (< 10 seconds)
- [x] Give breaths every 6 seconds (if advanced airway)
- [x] Switch compressor every 5 cycles (2 mins)

**Rationale**:
> Hyperventilation kills (increases intrathoracic pressure, decreases venous return). Everything else is standard ACLS.

### Step 3: BOWTIE
**Prompt**: We get ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation). Patient follows commands? NO. Prioritize post-arrest care.

**Correct Answer**:
- **Condition**: Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)
- **Actions to Take**:
  - Cool to 32-36 C
  - Sedate and Paralyze (if shivering)
- **Parameters to Monitor**:
  - Core Temperature (Esophageal)
  - EEG

**Rationale**:
> If the patient doesn't wake up after ROSC, we cool them (Therapeutic Hypothermia) to preserve brain function. Shivering fights the cooling and must be stopped. 12-Lead is also crucial to look for STEMI.
